&lt;p&gt;You see it everywhere you go, whether it’s in news publications, blogs, or social media posts; at industry conferences; or even through word of mouth from friends or colleagues: Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way the world operates. You might even be rolling your eyes at the mere mention of AI, machine learning, or even Big Data because you instinctively think of Hollywood blockbusters like “Terminator” or “I, Robot.” But don’t go running off yet; we promise that robots aren’t taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI and ML are more than just fancy buzzwords, and they’re certainly nothing to be afraid of. In fact, they’re real solutions to your biggest fundraising challenges. Stay with us through this blog as we explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-breakdown-artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The breakdown: artificial intelligence vs. machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how to leverage smart technology, like AI and ML, you need a full understanding of what that means. Uninformed decisions can be the pitfall of any nonprofit, and you don’t want to be caught in the trap of buying into a trendy idea or product without educating yourself. While AI and ML are often used interchangeably, each has unique characteristics and capabilities that distinguish one from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;what-is-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is artificial intelligence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google “What is artificial intelligence?” and you’ll find hundreds of thousands of helpful resources. But defining AI can often cause a lot of confusion if you’re not familiar with technical computer science lingo. In its simplest form, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nten.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nonprofits-and-Artificial-Intelligence_-February-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;AI is the process of using computer systems to automate human tasks,&lt;/a&gt; according to a resource from NTEN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while AI can alleviate some arduous tasks from humans, it is limited to making decisions based on what the data exactly shows — it cannot identify trends or make predictions based on available data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-is-machine-learning-different&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is machine learning different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, while AI and ML have been used interchangeably, these two processes are not the same. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/artificial-intelligence-ai-vs-machine-learning/#introduction&quot;&gt;ML is an application of AI&lt;/a&gt; and is more sophisticated in what it can do. AI makes decisions on what the data tells it, but ML can identify patterns, make predictions, and learn and improve itself over time based on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty is that ML can process data much faster than one person can, creating a more streamlined process for analyzing data. However, that doesn’t mean that robots are here to replace humans, rendering them obsolete. Quite the contrary: ML gives nonprofits the opportunity to scale and optimize by freeing up staff time to contribute more to critical tasks related to the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;artificial-intelligence--machine-learning--opportunities-for-nonprofits&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence &amp;amp; machine learning — opportunities for nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the digital transformation, nonprofits finally have access to innovative resources that have long been available in the e-commerce space, helping for-profit companies operate faster, smarter, and better — like chatbots able to answer frequently asked questions or product recommendations (think of the “Recommended for You” section on your Netflix library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still skeptics in the sector about smart technology, but the truth is that a whopping 89% of nonprofit professionals believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aaac-issues-first-state-of-artificial-intelligence-in-advancement-report-300883857.html&quot;&gt;AI can improve their organization’s efficiency.&lt;/a&gt;  And there are a number of ways that nonprofits are already utilizing AI and ML every day to preserve more time, resources, and energy. Use cases include streamlining administrative tasks, prospect research, wealth management, segmentation, and perhaps most important, online giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about how AI and ML can help you create a donor experience that helps you acquire new donors, improve your donor retention rate, and effortlessly increase fundraising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;fundraise-smarter-with-artificial-intelligence--machine-learning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraise smarter with artificial intelligence &amp;amp; machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our digital-first world has caused an unwavering dependence on digital tools, changing the way our donors give and informing them of which organizations they want to give to. Because of our saturated marketplace — with organizations with similar missions competing for the same dollars — nonprofits are now faced with a complex challenge: how to craft compelling messaging that urges people to give but also creating an enjoyable and memorable online giving experience that they will want to come back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;a-tailored-donation-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tailored donation experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly understand how to improve your donor’s giving experience, you have to acknowledge that your donors aren’t just donors — they’re also consumers, they have different preferences, and they have unique interests. So, like it or not, whenever someone stumbles upon your website looking to donate, their giving experience with your nonprofit is being compared to their consumer experiences at their favorite websites. With companies like Amazon streamlining the shopping experience by allowing consumers to check out instantly with a one-click button and receive a personalized individual experience with product recommendations based on shopping activity, how can nonprofits mirror that same experience? Enter: smart technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up creates a streamlined and tailored donation experience that will not only impress website visitors but one that will convert more visitors into donors. We understand how much thought you put into making sure you’re asking for the right donation amount, but with such a diverse pool of donors with different giving capacities, how can you pinpoint which donation levels resonate with everyone? For this very reason, we take the guesswork out to make sure you’re asking for the right amount every single time. Our technology uses AI and ML algorithms to analyze more than 100 data points to intelligently predict how much someone is likely to donate based on their user activity, which has been proven successful from the nonprofits we work with. In fact, for Partners in Health, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/partners-in-health&quot;&gt;49% of donors choose one of the AI-suggested donation amounts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ab79b6a9-48b5-4c98-a98e-5bdbdac9347d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with our library of elements — buttons, forms, automated reminders, and more — you can now make every single page on your website a donation page, encouraging more donations and lessening the chance of donation abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d4b9ed65-0c64-4a6d-a209-ecc12b58bf20/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;automated-recurring-giving-options&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated recurring giving options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the number of recurring donors you have will automatically improve your donation retention rate. But oftentimes, nonprofits feel overwhelmed at the thought of creating an elaborate recurring giving program that they need to dedicate time, resources, and staff to. However, the good news is that you don’t have to schedule a full-blown campaign to convert one-time donors into recurring donors. Using smart technology, you can automatically embed a monthly giving ask into the donation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/11c4f928-ef38-44b9-9519-cbf75252de88/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Monthly Upsell automatically asks one-time donors to become monthly donors during the checkout process. Plus, with our smart technology capabilities, we calculate the right monthly donation amount to present to your website visitors, which has a high likelihood of boosting the lifetime value of your donors. By leveraging Fundraise Up, International Anti-Poaching Foundation was able to grow &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/international-anti-poaching-foundation&quot;&gt;its recurring donor retention rate by 88.2%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those looking to contribute a large one-time gift, our technology will automatically suggest that they become an annual recurring donor, helping you retain those high-net-worth donors.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, with Fundraise Up, donors]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/images-for-tributes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/images-for-tributes</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e01622f0-2b71-4e1e-b1a4-7562232f6e27/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicating a donation, whether in honor or in memory, is an important way for donors to add significance to their donation and better connect with your nonprofit&amp;#39;s cause. Now, with Fundraise Up, donors can choose from a variety of images to accompany their dedication; all pre-curated and categorized by your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;so-whats-changing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what&apos;s changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/5df8266dd7374b24b0a5bb2dda7526c2&quot;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;, when donors chose to share their dedication with someone by email, they could only accompany it with a single image that was pre-selected. While this allowed for tighter control over the dedication experience, the rigidity could hamper the connection between a supporter and your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;image-collections&quot;&gt;Image collections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can create a collection of images and organize them by theme or sentiment. When a donor goes to share their dedication by email, they can now choose the image they feel best corresponds with their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/534dabf2-7657-4677-a26c-4bb51db62dd8/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select up to four images per collection, and each collection can be customized to fit the needs of your organization. Collections can be displayed &amp;#34;In honor only&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;In memory only&amp;#34;, or entirely hidden from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, collections can be individually selected or excluded from a campaign. For example, let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re running a dedicated campaign for Valentine&amp;#39;s Day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/6a8442c0-c7bf-4ea3-aedc-28a595b65b44/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, a donor will see the pre-selected Valentine&amp;#39;s Day collection in their donor portal, where they can choose from one of four suggested images. For more evergreen campaigns you may be running, like those on your homepage, you can enable multiple collections for donors to cycle through and select the image of their choice. This provides your donors with a more bespoke dedication experience while keeping you in control of which images they can select.&lt;/p&gt;

This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/fundraise-up?__hstc=63523760.73f3b77db0c5abe198c01186e9ab5a41.1656367186912.1657042634845.1657045549682.21&amp;amp;__hssc=63523760.5.1657045549682&amp;amp;__hsfp=1191625704&quot;&gt;strategic partnership&lt;/a&gt; will enable nonprofits to provide their donors with a truly remarkable end-to-end experience. Whether it&amp;#39;s the first interaction with a prospective donor or sustained correspondence with a life-long supporter, nonprofits will be able to leverage the interconnective technology they need to attract, engage, and delight their donor base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is the first online fundraising platform to natively integrate with HubSpot and automatically synchronize donation data between the two platforms in real time. Donations made through the Fundraise Up platform will be stored in HubSpot as Deals and automatically associated with a Contact. When connected to HubSpot via OAuth, the integration will create a new &amp;#34;Fundraise Up Donations&amp;#34; Pipeline and a new &amp;#34;Recurring Plan&amp;#34; Custom Object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International fundraising is an opportunity for nonprofits to broaden their donor base outside of their home country to generate even more funds for their critical missions. However, due to limitations in technology and the inability to communicate with donors in their preferred languages, nonprofits have often been faced with a slew of challenges that have hindered them from reaching these donors effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is revolutionizing the way you reach supporters all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the addition of German, Dutch, Norwegian, and Finnish to our growing suite of languages available for localization. Languages also available for localization include English (US, UK, CA), French (CA), and Spanish (LATAM), and we plan to launch even more throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;Previously announced in March,&lt;/a&gt; Fundraise Up is empowering nonprofits to localize website content by dynamically displaying the donor’s preferred language on buttons and labels in the donation Checkout and the Donor Portal. Plus, organizations can even translate customized text for the donation Checkout, emails, Elements, and Donor Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While localization is a vital piece to fundraising internationally, global success lies in understanding and embracing &lt;a href=&quot;/9e5afd1a07514fa6a6f344ec8cb960d0&quot;&gt;internationalization,&lt;/a&gt; which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Localizing website content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering country-specific payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using web design features that are unique to specific countries (e.g., structuring copy right to left for Arabic or Hebrew)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up understands the critical role internationalization plays in fundraising around the world. With our internationalization tools, you can be sure to reach every single donor — wherever they are.

At the heart of the Fundraise Up platform are two core technologies that set us apart from other online]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/machine-learning</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/machine-learning</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b92aeb81-97d8-4b2f-84b4-45e2ef2c40b6/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=025fd23c-8fb6-4738-bf95-32b8533f77c1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, the machines are not taking over the world, but they are improving the online donation experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Fundraise Up platform are two core technologies that set us apart from other online donation platforms — artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s machine learning? Put simply, it&amp;#39;s a subset of artificial intelligence that enables a system (a machine) to learn from the information that&amp;#39;s fed into it. Importantly, this learned information is used to improve the system without manual programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/c6a5bb69-fe38-43bc-933c-a602a1aef967/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above: Individualization is important. Ask for too little and you&amp;#39;ll miss out on revenue; ask for too much and you&amp;#39;ll lose donors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why machine learning matters in fundraising. Traditionally, fundraisers have been able to use their donor databases to craft individualized ask amounts for donors that they can then include in direct mail and email solicitations. This practice is smart because it recognizes that not all donors give in the same way. For some donors, $100 might feel like giving a major gift, while for others, $1,000 is a drop in the bucket. By individualizing the ask amounts in solicitations, you meet donors where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blank space in the art of individualizing donation asks is the nonprofit website. Think about your own website&amp;#39;s donation form — what amounts are included in the suggested donation array? It&amp;#39;s not uncommon to see amounts like $10, $25, $50, $100 and so forth. At first, it might feel like this approach makes sense. Bills come in $10, $50, and $100 denominations, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a47bb95c-7807-4b88-89ea-68c8926bb78f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above: A typical suggestion donation array. The amounts here are static — they aren&amp;#39;t individualized for each website visitor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember that the magic in individualizing those direct mail and email solicitations is meeting donors where they are and removing friction from the opportunities for them to give.  So what does that mean for your online form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without individualizing the donation experience, are you creating friction and potentially losing support? Unfortunately, the answer is yes, and until recently, there wasn&amp;#39;t a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we built the Fundraise Up platform, we did it with the objective of removing friction from the donation experience. The best way to accomplish this, we found, was by taking advantage of technology that could be taught by donor behavior — machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone visits your website for the first time, we start learning about them. In fact, we look at over 100 data points to help us better understand who they are and what suggested donation amounts make the most sense for them. Location, device type, donation history, and even holidays influence our algorithm&amp;#39;s donation suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/fa708210-90af-41c8-a063-618f58e35fb8/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above: Over 200 data points influence Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s machine learning model to create individualized donation asks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, as more people visit your website and become donors, our algorithm develops an understanding of who gives what, when they give, how they give, and what devices they use to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the questions our machine learning algorithm is able to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Brooklyn, what suggested donation amounts make the most sense for an iPhone user?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Christmas day at 3 P.M., what suggested donation amounts work best for desktop users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the best-suggested donation amounts for someone whose cell carrier is AT&amp;amp;T?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/98b2953c-fd91-456e-92f8-bd5727af9bfc/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above: As our machine learning algorithm learns, it&amp;#39;s able to to suggest donation amounts based on groupings of data.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of our machine learning individualization? &lt;strong&gt;Over 50% of your website visitors convert to donors and give using a suggested donation amount.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that you get more donations from a greater number of donors and see an overall lift in donation revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is key to helping our customers grow and it&amp;#39;s part of what makes our platform unique, powerful, and capable of bringing individualization to the online donation space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=f8af3a81-dcd5-4d48-a27f-8b78d3280ba8&gt;Are you ready to engage your donors as fundraisers on your website?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/p2p&quot;&gt;P2P Fundraisers&lt;/a&gt; feature is the best way to engage your donors as fundraisers. Not only is the P2P feature quick to configure, but it also makes launching a fundraiser directly from your website fast and easy for every donor. And if you follow our four tips for making your website P2P perfect, you&amp;#39;ll be ready to run a winning P2P campaign in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=76632a6d-b052-4e4a-aa73-9c2f7a7c8e9f&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Create a clear call to action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e6c93a21-97ac-4e45-a647-79dd8a795199/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the term, &amp;#34;below the fold&amp;#34;? The term comes from broadsheet newspaper production, but the concept of presenting your most important information at the top of the page remains — your &amp;#34;Start a Fundraiser&amp;#34; call to action is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend placing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/p2p-button&quot;&gt;P2P Button&lt;/a&gt; front and center, and near the top of your webpage. Limit visual distractions by placing text, pictures, videos, and other components below your call to action. This layout approach ensures that your website visitors have a clear action to take — start a fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=43f0147a-1632-4a4d-8ff3-08b1eb6bb7f7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Use Goal Meter to show progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/8c0d185d-1992-4455-afdb-dccab90cba14/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/goal-meter&quot;&gt;Goal Meter&lt;/a&gt; is a great Element for visualizing progress toward your campaign&amp;#39;s goal. Not only does Goal Meter engage website visitors, but it also gives donors a clear view of the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recommendation with Goal Meter is to place it in a prominent location, preferably near the top of the webpage so it&amp;#39;s immediately visible when someone visits your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=3d7135b0-071a-404c-bf45-ec4664a6f5f9&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Include Top Fundraisers for social proof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/18444de1-1aa6-4572-890e-b061e3528d93/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/top-fundraisers&quot;&gt;Top Fundraisers&lt;/a&gt; Element is perfect for demonstrating social proof. Your website visitors will be more inclined to launch fundraisers when they see that others have done so before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use Top Fundraisers to introduce an element of light-hearted competition, perfect for motivating your supporters to further engage their personal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend placing Top Fundraisers alongside the other content items on your page. If your website layout allows you to place content in columns, include your most important content in a wider left column, and place Top Fundraisers in a smaller right column. It&amp;#39;s also a good idea to place a P2P Button near Top Fundraisers to make it easy for website visitors to start their own fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=f46b5493-9bd6-4530-a32e-829b508d074a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Provide answers to common questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/27460bce-a282-4a0b-a8ff-3ba50fcdb692/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website visitors might have questions about launching and running their own fundraisers. By including a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section on your page, you can quickly provide assistance that might otherwise require an email exchange or phone conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the FAQ section is not as important as the call to action, we recommend placing the FAQ below the CTA, Goal Meter, and Top Fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a sample of questions you might include in your FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I start my fundraiser?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s the best way to share with people that I&amp;#39;m running a fundraiser?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I track who&amp;#39;s given to my fundraiser?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=902a6b25-2004-4078-a40d-b155b526ecf9&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re set!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your freshly P2P-enhanced website, you&amp;#39;ll be ready to run your winning campaign — and we&amp;#39;d love to hear about it! And if you need help with P2P or want more information, connect with our team below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=efd6a4b2-4136-46aa-8a63-5c1d7f60561d&gt;Monthly Upsell operates automatically to get you more donors and donations.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a monthly giving program? A lot of organizations we chat with share that they shied away from monthly giving before using Fundraise Up, not because they don’t think it’s important, but because it seems like a lot of work — and it can be — but it doesn’t have to be. Enter Monthly Upsell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly Upsell is a powerful feature that automatically and intelligently encourages one-time donors to convert to monthly support during checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging our machine learning capabilities, we’re able to calculate the right monthly donation amounts to present to your website visitors. In fact, we only show suggested amounts that will boost the lifetime value (LTV) of your donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complement the machine learning magic happening behind the scenes, we incorporate psychology-driven design into the checkout experience. Using subtle visual cues, we’re able to motivate donors to show greater monthly support to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/904f4203-2905-4b47-846a-69d98e9bf662/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above: Monthly Upsell in action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? &lt;strong&gt;Over 40% of your one-time donors switch to showing monthly support&lt;/strong&gt;. For the International Community Foundation (ICF), for example, this meant moving from 17 to over 200 monthly donors and seeing an online giving revenue increase of 46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, you don’t need to spend precious budget soliciting donors to join your monthly giving program, and not a single email or direct mail appeal has to be sent to garner recurring support. Monthly Upsell operates automatically to get you more donors and donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to learn more? &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/international-community-foundation&quot;&gt;Read our ICF case study&lt;/a&gt; on monthly giving, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/recurring-giving&quot;&gt;dive in with our recurring giving feature&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ropsi.org/&quot;&gt;head over to our demo website&lt;/a&gt; to see Monthly Upsell in action.&lt;/p&gt;

Recurring donors are the key to skyrocketing your donor retention numbers. Not only do recurring]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/donation-repair</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/donation-repair</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/6d97702a-9667-4a27-9b55-5d9409ef150c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ddcdc8bf-ee5f-47c0-91c7-b15e8dc1063f&gt;When something goes wrong with a recurring donor&amp;#39;s payment, do you lose the donor? Not with Fundraise Up.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurring donors are the key to skyrocketing your donor retention numbers. Not only do recurring donors boast an impressive 90% retention rate (45 percentage points above their one-time donor counterparts), by the end of the year, recurring donors will have also given 42% more than one-time donors. But what happens when a recurring donor&amp;#39;s credit card expires or gets replaced? Do you lose the donor? Not with Fundraise Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=7465a228-ff2a-4c37-b8c9-b072cecd9e69&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-update saved cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/1fe15747-5ccc-4fba-be88-f48e46020261/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our donation repair technology leverages Stripe&amp;#39;s automatic collection feature to reduce processing issues with the saved card your donor uses for their recurring donation. This means that most American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and Discover cards issued in the U.S. can be automatically updated even when your donor replaces the physical payment card. Stripe&amp;#39;s automatic collection feature runs in the background 24/7 to keep your donor&amp;#39;s details up to date — no need to manually check the status of your recurring donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4b58a319-6e11-4f9a-a861-f90e35b35210&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart retries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/df821133-0988-42e2-ab47-cfd1d74b54a8/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when your recurring donor&amp;#39;s saved card hasn&amp;#39;t expired or been replaced, there are times when charging the card fails. This is where our Smart Retries technology comes in handy. Using Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/machine-learning&quot;&gt;machine learning algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re able to determine the ideal time to retry failed payments. For example, we might find that 1:15 P.M. on a Tuesday is the best time to successfully charge a card, and use that for future retries. Like Stripe&amp;#39;s automatic collection feature, our Smart Retry technology is constantly running behind the scenes and requires no extra work on your part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=620b8976-a481-4a6b-b8e2-ae6c8b55c465&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donor alerts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/89d42712-5280-4bca-ac14-8bb219eb765b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting your donor know when something goes wrong with their payment helps reduce the chance of their recurring donation expiring. But you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to spend time writing emails to your donor about the issue. That&amp;#39;s why Fundraise Up automatically &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/automated-emails&quot;&gt;sends alerts to your donors&lt;/a&gt; when they need to take action. Your organization also receives notifications about payment issues so you can check in with your donor as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ac988cec-1c78-408b-839f-2c3ff2726106&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donor Portal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/003526d3-b37b-4f99-a740-6557a6efe640/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of your donors has access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/donor-portal&quot;&gt;Donor Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a self-service webpage where they can manage their recurring donations and download PDF receipts for past donations. Most importantly, they can manage three key settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update payment method&lt;/strong&gt; — Your donor can quickly change the payment method they use for their recurring donations. For example, when your donor wants to switch from making their donations from a credit card to a bank account without disruption, they can do so using Update Payment Method in Donor Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change amount &lt;/strong&gt;— Your donor can quickly update the size of their recurring donation. This is a useful option because it gives your donor the flexibility to lower their donation amount rather than outright canceling the recurring plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change date &lt;/strong&gt;— Your donor can quickly change the date on which their payment method is charged. This option is meant for when your donor wants to better align their giving with their personal finances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=9132fd7e-e32a-411d-bbb4-3b9a4bcbf2b9&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe&amp;#39;s tech, our machine learning, alerts, and Donor Portal, combine to power Donation Repair, a feature that works intelligently behind the scenes to keep the donations flowing and which also plays an active role in supporting your retention numbers. Are you already using Fundraise Up? Donation Repair is already active and working to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

You're probably familiar with this call: the one where a donor phones your organization's office to request a stack of donation]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/save-time-with-donor-portal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/save-time-with-donor-portal</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a94c3068-2105-43e7-952b-76f02f1eb125/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4fb2bdcf-e898-40ce-9dfe-376f0a08e512&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donor Portal saves you time and cuts down on donor attrition — here&amp;#39;s how.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re probably familiar with this call: the one where a donor phones your organization&amp;#39;s office to request a stack of donation receipts, make a change to their recurring plan or even cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call takes precious time for your day and means digging through your CRM&amp;#39;s records to locate the donor&amp;#39;s account, generate a receipt letter, or find the details of the donor&amp;#39;s recurring plan. It shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be this way, and with Donor Portal, it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/9a869e95-01e9-40cd-a3c9-5440041a52cc/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Donor Portal gives your donors easy access to their recurring plans, receipts, and even P2P Fundraisers they&amp;#39;re running.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor Portal is a free self-service dashboard that every donor has access to when your organization uses Fundraise Up. It&amp;#39;s easy to use and access — donors don&amp;#39;t even have to worry about managing yet another username and password — Donor Portal is accessible using a secure, magic link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as this post&amp;#39;s title suggests, Donor Portal saves you time and cuts down on donor attrition — here&amp;#39;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=78c37a37-521a-42f7-b5e9-9523ae578824&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⏰ Donor Portal saves you time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/2c7b1f9d-623d-4666-b55e-e0616c8b5768/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Donors don&amp;#39;t have to call you in order to update their recurring plans — they can make changes directly from the Donor Portal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s have the next call to your office be from a donor ready to write a big check, not someone needing a stack of receipts. With Donor Portal, every donor can view their donation history and download PDF receipts for each donation they&amp;#39;ve made to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason a donor might call your office is to update the donation amount for their recurring gift or to change the day of the month on which the gift is given. With Donor Portal, your donors can easily update a recurring plan&amp;#39;s donation amount and installment schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since your donor is empowered to update their own plan through Donor Portal, there&amp;#39;s no need for them to call into your office and you save time that can be dedicated to strategy and stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=875ad096-7714-4a51-a5a3-fedf3d640cbe&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📉 Donor Portal cuts down on attrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/790165a2-6299-4bf5-8f1f-279f028b3b85/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rather than canceling their recurring plan, a donor can put it on pause for a few months.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to lose recurring donors and see an unfortunate spike in donor attrition is to make canceling a recurring gift the only option for donors who need to adjust their level of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Donor Portal, there are two key attrition-busting features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a donor can easily, and at any time, adjust their level of support in Donor Portal to fit their needs or financial situation. And of course, when the donor is ready, they can increase their giving amount back to its previous level or even opt to give more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, even if a donor moves to cancel their recurring plan, Donor Portal will automatically prompt them to consider modifying the plan rather than canceling it. By modifying their recurring plan, a donor can reduce the size of their monthly gift or even pause the plan for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=f6b13e50-e406-41ec-97bd-e559805944f6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎨 Match Donor Portal to your look and feel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the Fundraise Up platform, Donor Portal is customizable to match the look and feel of your organization. You can upload your logo, include an impactful image, and customize the text to engage your donors. You can even configure Donor Portal to use your own subdomain for a more deeply branded experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e9d6c187-16a3-44b7-84b0-ac28980890cb&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🙌 Ready to get started with Fundraise Up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor Portal and so many other Fundraise Up features help you convert more website visitors to donors, get better donations from a greater number of donors, and boost monthly support. And because there are zero monthly or annual fees, no contracts, and free onboarding and support, your organization can get started with Fundraise Up today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An exciting update is coming to Fundraise Up's recurring giving feature]]></title><description><![CDATA[Say hello to saved costs, more options, and better control over recurring plans.

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=55948c31-bc2b-4148-a0ce-efcffcb60c9e&gt;Say hello to saved costs, more options, and better control over recurring plans.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we&amp;#39;re excited to announce an upcoming update to Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s Recurring Giving feature that enhances the way recurring plans are started and how they are managed. Take a look at what&amp;#39;s coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=bab87a76-a861-496c-bece-eebcabd3ee1d&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💰 Save money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe recently introduced a 0.5% fee for subscription-style transactions like recurring donations. We&amp;#39;re engineering some behind-the-scenes magic to mitigate this fee and boost the value of recurring donations for all of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=340d111b-7fbc-4573-80c7-68f471cc1518&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🗓 More options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your donors have always had the ability to give monthly using Fundraise Up, but later this year, your donors will have the ability to select new donation frequencies like weekly, quarterly, and annually. Donors will now also be able to specify a start date for their recurring plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to new frequencies for recurring plans, we&amp;#39;re also expanding the payment methods available for recurring plans to include PayPal, which was previously only available for one-time donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4edd1de1-9d10-4ba6-9e45-6c3defdf0350&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎛 Better control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new enhancements to recurring plans, you&amp;#39;ll now have control over how Fundraise Up handles failed charges on installments for recurring donations. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/settings/recurring-plans&quot;&gt;Recurring Plans&lt;/a&gt; option allows you to set a static retry schedule for failed charges or opt to leverage Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s machine learning algorithm to set an optimized retry schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4be1b736-57b7-4104-8f2d-bac7eb5f658e&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🤩 Coming soon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhancements to recurring plans are coming soon, but setting the retry schedule for Recurring Plans can be done today and will take effect in mid-January, 2021. Stay tuned — we&amp;#39;ll keep you posted as more enhancements to recurring plans become available.&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, most nonprofits push donors to off-site web pages to donate. This approach is bad for conversion and leads]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/off-site-donation-form-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/off-site-donation-form-research</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/59c0499d-cb5f-4d8a-9458-b9b88b24114a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=a5df6a71-cf3e-45aa-bb0a-7e0473bf543d&gt;When a donor wants to give to your nonprofit it shouldn’t mean leaving your website.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, most nonprofits push donors to off-site web pages to donate. This approach is bad for conversion and leads to fewer donations. Let’s look at how an instantly loading on-page donation form limits conversion loss and drives donation revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your online donors as weary travelers traversing the ad-packed, content-filled landscape of the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a31db00d-4b9a-4ac8-ae2e-d2e8a76c7a32/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When website visitors click the donation button on most nonprofit websites, they&amp;#39;re redirected to off-page or off-site donation forms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time your donors arrive at the threshold of your nonprofit&amp;#39;s digital door, they’re tired. But they want to show their support, and for a moment, you have their attention. They&amp;#39;ll read your impact story and watch your moving video, and be ready to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But showing support can’t cost your digitally-weary donors energy they don’t have, and when there are extra steps involved in making a donation, your donors are sure to think twice about committing to the journey. This is the impact redirects and off-site donation forms have on conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly is conversion? In the world of e-commerce, conversion is the process of enticing a digital passersby with products and persuading them to make purchases and become customers. In the context of nonprofit fundraising, conversion is no different except that the product you’re selling is your mission and the customers are your donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/51bd9eca-a557-401a-82a1-45f00226a46d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you hear that redirects and off-site web pages hurt conversion, it means that fewer website visitors are actually committing to making donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research on donation form conversion has revealed four main giving form click-to-view behaviors found on nonprofit websites. All but one of them have a pronounced and negative impact on conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/46df32c1-969f-45a5-9066-d591bb2a87d7/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the click-to-view conversion impact of our own platform&amp;#39;s donation form behavior, we conducted A/B tests with several nationally established nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the tests, each nonprofit&amp;#39;s navigation bar donation button was set to direct 50% of website visitors to the organization&amp;#39;s existing donation form (the control), and 50% to the Fundraise Up donation experience (the test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a year, we measured conversion statistics for more than 5.6 million website visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/17a65c04-170a-4718-aa8b-305813846e62/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of our A/B tests revealed two key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though the donation button connected to the test (Fundraise Up) form was clicked fewer times, the test form itself received a higher number of views from website visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The control form saw an 8% drop in views while the test form (Fundraise Up) saw just a 0.7% drop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/dd722ea2-33d6-44fe-a514-cff65ee08b0c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A 90/10 split test performed with a nationally-established nonprofit shows not only the control form&amp;#39;s click-to-view drop, but the overall impact that opening a new tab has on conversion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for a higher click-to-view drop with off-site donation forms are numerous and difficult to track and report on, but they can include issues like pages that take too long to load (or don&amp;#39;t load), ad-blockers that prevent new browser tabs from opening, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A higher click-to-view drop rate is more than just a negative stat — it reveals a major pain point: fewer donations from a smaller number of donors leading to less donation revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/51ca3d15-1c82-44d0-917c-6f6255dbc749/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because our platform is integrated into the very code of a nonprofit&amp;#39;s website, a Fundraise Up donation form can launch on any page.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is built to boost conversion and turn more website visitors into donors. That&amp;#39;s why rather than pushing donors offsite, our donation experience instantly launches on the page where a visitor clicks &amp;#34;donate&amp;#34;. In fact, because our platform is integrated into the very code of a nonprofit&amp;#39;s website, a Fundraise Up donation form can launch on any page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a minimal impact on conversion, Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s instantly loading on-page donation experience has proven to be the best solution for converting the most website visitors to donors and seeing the greatest online giving performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=2f8f2d59-eed9-4f53-a0f4-9950421622fe&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to get started with Fundraise Up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up helps you convert more website visitors to donors, get better donations from a greater number of donors, and boost monthly support. And because there are zero monthly or annual fees, no contracts, and free onboarding and support, your organization can get started with Fundraise Up today! 🙌&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research: Social media sharing icons shown post-donation further engage donors by 15%]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a donor makes a donation using Fundraise Up, we show them the Thank You Screen, and with Thank You Screen, you have the opportunity to display a set of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and email sharing]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/social-media-icon-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/social-media-icon-research</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/4ca1e2d7-0203-451f-b983-fd9f0dc3caf3/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a donor makes a donation using Fundraise Up, we show them the Thank You Screen, and with Thank You Screen, you have the opportunity to display a set of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and email sharing buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social sharing is great for building awareness about your cause, and it&amp;#39;s perfect for letting your donors share with their networks that they showed support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a 2014 study by Ogilvy and SurveyMonkey found that the number one reason people hit &amp;#34;share&amp;#34; is to promote a cause or issue, so it makes sense to include social sharing buttons as a post-donation call to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who opts to share? Where do they share? To answer these questions, we ran a three-month test that looked at 62,000 donors who were shown Thank You Screen with social sharing buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 62,000 donors, 9,400 of them (15%) went on to share via social media or email that they made a donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook was the most popular network amongst donors, occupying 54% of social shares. Surprisingly, neither Twitter nor LinkedIn was in line right after Facebook. Instead, 30% of donors chose to share via email that they donated, with Twitter and LinkedIn capturing 10% and 5% respectively of social shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our three-month test confirmed our understanding of the social sharing behavior of donors: that one out of every four donors opts to share on social media that they gave to a nonprofit — pretty neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you using social sharing buttons as a post-donation call to action? If not, now&amp;#39;s a great time to roll them out on your donation form. And if haven&amp;#39;t yet tried Fundraise Up, book a demo to see how social sharing, AI, machine learning, and more provide your donors with a better donation experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Showing PayPal as a donation method leads to a 10% conversion hike]]></title><description><![CDATA[A new finding from our analytics team reveals the positive impact PayPal has on conversion.

&lt;p&gt;A new finding from our analytics team reveals the positive impact PayPal has on conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine both the popularity and conversion impact of PayPal as a donation method, our team analyzed more than 170,000 transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the studied transactions, it was found that &lt;strong&gt;PayPal is selected during a donation checkout 20% of the time&lt;/strong&gt;, making it the second most popular donation method behind card-based options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Fundraise Up data reveals that PayPal has an overall positive impact on conversion regardless of whether it’s selected by a supporter as a donation method. &lt;strong&gt;When the option to give using PayPal is present, the conversion rate rises by 10%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal is a popular choice for digital donors — one in five donors selects it during the donation checkout process. And because PayPal’s very presence at checkout can increase conversion by several percentage points, we recommend implementing PayPal as a donation option where possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 reasons why you should migrate your recurring donors to Fundraise Up]]></title><description><![CDATA[Moving fundraising platforms can seem like a daunting task, especially when you have to move hundreds if not thousands of recurring donors — but we have your back.

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=727b8ef5-d0b9-41cf-87c7-7a497752da0f&gt;Moving fundraising platforms can seem like a daunting task, especially when you have to move hundreds if not thousands of recurring donors — but we have your back.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily migrate any number of recurring donors from your legacy fundraising solution to Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s AI-powered platform. Here are six reasons why it&amp;#39;s a smart move:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=dfdef149-a4b4-4daa-9a09-9c147668f29f&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Access all donor information from one centralized location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving your donors to Fundraise Up removes the headache of wrangling one-time and recurring donors in separate platforms. Manage everyone in one place with ease when you migrate your recurring donors to Fundraise Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=dce17dbd-e438-4391-965b-ae58b8ec830d&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Donor Portal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give all donors full control over their donations with the Donor Portal, a secure, self-service dashboard for managing recurring plans, receipts, and one-time gifts. The Donor Portal was built with retention in mind. Its smart features help prevent recurring plans from being canceled and donation repair tools ensure support doesn&amp;#39;t end when donors update or replace their payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4f72ec03-348c-44eb-96f3-c7477428566c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. No downtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving your recurring donors shouldn&amp;#39;t mean losing valuable donation revenue during the switch. Thanks to Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s 99.9% uptime SLA, your donors&amp;#39; recurring plans are migrated live with little to no impact on the day-to-day donor experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=0bef8d65-25c6-4a90-92ac-e3643d315662&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Fast turnaround&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be used to legacy solution providers that drag their feet when it comes to your data requests, but at Fundraise Up, we&amp;#39;re dedicated to helping you migrate all of your recurring donors to the platform in days, not weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=2fe04257-1583-4115-a886-fb719ef75dd5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. 1-to-1 assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating recurring donors is no small technical feat, and the last thing you want is to go it alone. When you move your recurring donors to Fundraise Up, you can rest easy knowing that your migration is in good hands with one of our dedicated migration specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=0dba246c-89ff-4d43-a570-f468166c5eb1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. $0 Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read that right. There&amp;#39;s no cost to move your recurring donors to Fundraise Up. Whether you&amp;#39;re moving 10 or 10,000 recurring donors, you never have to worry about footing a bill for the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=d8f858ed-49cf-4613-b11d-db33c65e7de6&gt;Say hello to QR Code, the latest addition to our growing library of powerful Elements.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With QR Code, you can generate a scannable code that sends donors directly to a Fundraise Up Checkout on your nonprofit’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR Code can be embedded on a website or downloaded as an image that you can add to digital assets like slide decks and social media posts, or incorporated into print products like direct mail appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like all Fundraise Up Elements, QR Code is incredibly customizable. You can modify its size, color, and other attributes, and even include a custom image at the center of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, QR Code can be updated in real-time from your Fundraise Up dashboard! So even when a fundraising campaign ends, your QR Code can be updated to send donors to any other Fundraise Up Checkout in your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, QR codes are a great way to collect donations. And with millions of mobile devices capable of automatically scanning QR codes, you can easily engage all segments of your donor base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to get started with QR Code? &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/elements&quot;&gt;Create your first code from the Elements tab of your Fundraise Up dashboard.&lt;/a&gt; Not yet using Fundraising Up? &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request&quot;&gt;Get started today with a demo from our Nonprofit Success team.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Use the psychology-inspired Social Proof Element to gain more donors]]></title><description><![CDATA[Introducing Social Proof, the new Element inspired by psychology.

&lt;p&gt;Your donors are no different from consumers — they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; consumers after all. The same social influence (purchases by others, recommendations, etc.) that motivate consumer behavior can be leveraged to encourage donations to your nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone visits your nonprofit’s website, Social Proof will pop up in the lower-left corner of the website and display recent donations from your supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Proof displays a supporter’s first name, donation, and donation designation. Based on the donor’s location, Social Proof will also display the state or province and country where the donation was made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all Fundraise Up Elements, Social Proof can be styled to match your nonprofit’s website. You can even make updates to Social Proof in real-time from the Fundraise Up dashboard and see the changes immediately reflected on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a3f9f58f-5799-43b2-80de-46d338638bf2/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to add Social Proof to your website? Head to the Elements section of your Fundraise Up dashboard to get started. And if you’re not yet using Fundraise Up, you can learn more about Elements and the platform&amp;#39;s other conversion-boosting features at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/&quot;&gt;fundraiseup.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social Proof shows content based on the 10 previous donations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donations shown are ordered from oldest to newest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Proof is shown when a new donation is made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Proof is shown for 50% of page views.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re hosting a day of giving, streaming a live event, or running a P2P fundraising campaign, Recent Donations is the perfect Element for showing how donors are rallying around your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new Recent Donations Element, you can show a list of up to 10 recent donations from your supporters. You can include a donor’s full name or abbreviate it to just show the first name and last initial, toggle the visibility of dates and donation comments, and of course, stylize Recent Donations to match the design of your nonprofit’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Donations joins the ever-growing library of Elements, our conversion-boosting UI components that you can place anywhere on your website. Use Recent Donations on its own or embed it with other Elements like &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/donation-form&quot;&gt;Donation Form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/goal-meter&quot;&gt;Goal Meter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/image-card&quot;&gt;Image Card&lt;/a&gt; to create a truly engaging call to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to get started with Recent Donations?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooklyn, New York (March 10, 2021)&lt;/strong&gt; — Fundraise Up has partnered with Neon One to release an API-based integration for Neon CRM, Neon One&amp;#39;s fundraising, membership, events, and website platform for nonprofits. The Neon CRM integration is available now for all Fundraise Up customers at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new integration leverages Neon CRM&amp;#39;s REST API to automatically synchronize donation data from Fundraise Up to Neon CRM in near real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping rules, a hallmark of Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s integration tools, enable a nonprofit to specify how data is transmitted to Neon CRM and even write data to organization-specific custom fields in Neon CRM. Special mapping rules further extend the integration&amp;#39;s functionality by making it possible to create campaign and designation-specific mappings for advanced data management and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Neon CRM integration is number six in a growing suite of native integrations from Fundraise Up that includes Salesforce, Raiser&amp;#39;s Edge NXT, Kindful, Bloomerang, and Double the Donation 360MatchPro. Up to seven additional API-based CRM integrations are slated for release before the close of Q4 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Fundraise Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is a rapidly growing financial technology company headquartered in Brooklyn, NY that provides online fundraising software to enterprise nonprofits.

&lt;p&gt;Message bar-style notifications are popular for showing important, timely information to website visitors. Online retailers, for example, use message bars to inform shoppers of sales, discounts, and membership perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nonprofits, message bars can be used as attention-grabbing calls to action that prompt website visitors to donate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways you can use Message Bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To promote support for a giving day campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To alert donors of a pressing need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To encourage giving to a year-end campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To collect donations for a holiday or special event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To engage donors with your recurring giving program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like every Fundraise Up Element, Message Bar can be styled to match the design of your nonprofit&amp;#39;s website. Settings for Element behavior, alignment, and visibility provide additional options for customizing Message Bar to your nonprofit&amp;#39;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message Bar is available to all Fundraise Up customers and can be added from the Elements tab of the account dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Message Bar or to get help with displaying it on your nonprofit&amp;#39;s website, speak with your Nonprofit Success Engineer.

&lt;p&gt;Elements are interactive UI components that can be placed anywhere on a nonprofit&amp;#39;s website to engage website visitors as donors. Our library of Elements includes an array of customizable buttons, progress bars, sliders, notifications, and other components. Elements can be managed, updated, and tracked directly from a nonprofit&amp;#39;s account dashboard without a developer or webmaster, making them a powerful asset for agile digital fundraising teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital marketers have long used marketing automation platforms to segment their audiences and personalize email outreach, and with good reason. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/white-papers/ccm-email-study-2013.pdf&quot;&gt;Experian reports&lt;/a&gt; that personalized subject lines lead to a 26% increase in open rates, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dma.org.uk/uploads/ckeditor/National-client-email-2015.pdf&quot;&gt;data from the DMA&lt;/a&gt; reveals a 760% increase in email revenue when segmentation is applied to campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with a recent update to Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s URL API, you can pass data like the personalization tags used in Mailchimp, to a Fundraise Up Checkout to streamline the donation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5b75e1fd-0dd8-4e09-a116-fe1709a612f7/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the illustration above, the marketing email includes a donation link that appends the email recipient&amp;#39;s personalization merge tags to the donation link that launches Checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the URL API, it was previously possible to pass a donation amount through a URL, but with the new update, you can now include a donor&amp;#39;s first name, last name, and email address, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because first name, last name, and email address are the only values required to complete a donation when these values are passed to Checkout in a URL, you remove the need for a donor to manually input their information and allow for a seamless donation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ed53a163-becc-490a-b82d-5b58bdff0633/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how after the payment details are confirmed, the donor&amp;#39;s information is already populated in the Personal Information fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take full advantage of Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s URL API, we recommend utilizing your CRM or marketing automation platform to segment your donor base by analyzing giving history, demographics, and psychographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your data to calculate ask amounts that you can merge into a marketing email and pass through in URLs to a Fundraise Up Checkout. In the event that a donor does not donate using your prefilled amount, there is a 50% chance that they will complete their donation using an amount suggested by our AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available now, the updated Exports tool introduces enterprise features that make it easier than ever for nonprofits to export data from Fundraise Up and import it into CRMs, data analysis tools, and custom applications. Here&amp;#39;s a look at everything that&amp;#39;s new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=5abf7a15-f044-4806-91a8-d02e9648f02c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/99a93273-c882-4418-bb2d-88859a0ec085/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every template can be customized to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With templates, you can now configure organization-wide export templates for any number of needs. For example, you can set up a template for succeeded donations that&amp;#39;s perfect for your finance team, and a separate template that includes only new recurring plans — a great option for team members managing monthly or annual giving programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/eb3de3ef-33e6-4a91-9402-7de868dd9362/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drag and drop editor makes it easy to customize template columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Exports tool also introduces a drag and drop editor for configuring templates. Pick and choose from available data points, rearrange columns as needed, and customize properties like date and currency formatting. You can even apply presets for importing data into platforms like Mailchimp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updated Exports tool lets you send your data to email addresses and SFTP locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now three ways to export your Fundraise Up data.  First, and just like with the previous version of Exports, you can click the download button to quickly get a CSV file of your data. Second, you can now configure one or more email addresses to receive data exported from Fundraise Up. This option is perfect for keeping development, finance, and stewardship teams in the loop about donations your nonprofit is receiving. Third, it&amp;#39;s now possible to add file server destinations using SFTP. For large nonprofits with complex custom workflows in place, this option provides valuable flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A powerful addition to the Exports tool, the new scheduling feature lets you automatically export data from Fundraise Up on a recurring basis. With options ranging from hourly to monthly, you can dial in your export scheduling to meet your team&amp;#39;s needs, and use destination toggles to send data only to the people or places that need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=de71feb3-8e22-4bbf-86e1-0e963a3f83fa&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Exports tool introduces a suite of new functionalities that are designed to streamline processing operations for enterprise nonprofits. While Fundraise Up will continue to develop and support API-based CRM integrations for platforms like Salesforce and Raiser&amp;#39;s Edge NXT, we recognize that the best way to support your data needs is with a platform-agnostic tool like Exports. This way, even if a software vendor changes or deprecates its API, we&amp;#39;ll still be able to provide data to you in a way that&amp;#39;s easy to import into your other fundraising tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re excited to introduce an incredible update to our integration with Double the Donation&amp;#39;s 360MatchPro platform: upsells to eligible match amounts. For our customers, this means larger donation sizes and an increase in match-eligible contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated feature educates donors while encouraging them to meet or exceed the minimum donation amount matched by their employer. This simple callout is especially valuable because mentioning matching gifts in fundraising appeals results in a 71% increase in response rate and a 51% increase in average donation amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to ensure every eligible donor has the opportunity to drive matching gift revenue for the causes they care about - and 360MatchPro provides the perfect avenue to accomplish that,” said Salvatore Salpietro, Chief Experience Officer at Fundraise Up. “This solution is going to give donors the opportunity to maximize the impact of their donation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/de40b4f5-6b07-4ae1-b4b8-2801efd4b675/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The new matching upsell feature encourages donors to meet or exceed the minimum donation amount matched by their employer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While matching gifts are widespread, many donors are unaware that they qualify for a gift matching program. The new upsell feature will not only close the donor awareness gap but also encourage larger donations and a greater number of match requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fundraise Up already uses innovative technology to drive donor conversion rates and satisfaction, so we are very excited to add an enhanced matching gift touchpoint to their donation flow,” said Adam Weinger, President of Double the Donation. “This enhancement will ensure no matching gift opportunities fall through the cracks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading nonprofits around the world are already leveraging 360MatchPro with Fundraise Up to drive support for their missions. For those nonprofits, the update has been automatically applied and they will see growth in their corporate matching program starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nonprofits not yet leveraging Fundraise Up with 360MatchPro, now is the perfect time to get started. &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request?source=Inbound%20Marketing&amp;amp;source_detail=Doublle%20the%20Donation%20Gift%20Matching%20Upsell%20Blog%20Post&amp;amp;source_agent=Request%20a%20Demo%20CTA&quot;&gt;Request a demo&lt;/a&gt; to learn how you can double your online donation revenue and triple your recurring donor acquisition rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooklyn, New York (June 9, 2021) —&lt;/strong&gt; Fundraise Up has released an API-based integration for DonorPerfect, a fundraising platform and CRM for nonprofits. The DonorPerfect integration is available now for all Fundraise Up customers at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new integration leverages DonorPerfect’s XML API to automatically synchronize donation data from Fundraise Up to DonorPerfect in near real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping rules, a hallmark of Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s integration tools, enable a nonprofit to specify how data is transmitted to DonorPerfect and even write data to organization-specific custom fields in DonorPerfect. Special mapping rules further extend the integration&amp;#39;s functionality by making it possible to create campaign and designation-specific mappings for advanced data management and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DonorPerfect integration is number seven in a growing suite of native integrations from Fundraise Up that includes Salesforce, Raiser&amp;#39;s Edge NXT, Neon CRM, Kindful, Bloomerang, and Double the Donation 360MatchPro. Additional integrations are available using Fundraise Up’s Zapier connector, and other API-based CRM integrations are slated for release before the close of Q4 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

That means that now is as good a time as any to review your fundraising campaigns]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/4-tips-for-next-fiscal-year</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/4-tips-for-next-fiscal-year</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Partner guest post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cathexispartners.com/&quot;&gt;Cathexis Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b3d21c25-abab-43fc-85e8-f744a74f98e4/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we head into the month of July, many nonprofits are starting a brand-new fiscal year. That means that now is as good a time as any to review your fundraising campaigns and think about how you can improve them for the next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you only need to make a few tweaks to your strategy, or perhaps it is time to try a whole new approach. In the end, the goal is the same - to make sure you are getting the largest return from your fundraising activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four ideas to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think “mobile-first” 
&lt;/strong&gt;With the widespread use of mobile devices and an increased proportion of people working from home or on the go, it is more important than ever to be sure your website and online transaction channels (a site visitor&amp;#39;s path from entering your site, to taking a specified action) remains easy to navigate via mobile devices. If you have not updated your nonprofit’s website within the last three years or so, that can be a good indication it is time for a review and to consider a refresh. A simple way to start is to compare your organization’s site against the site of a top-notch nonprofit. Here are a few great examples to provide you with some inspiration:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aftau.org/&quot;&gt;Tel Aviv University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedhopenow.org/&quot;&gt;Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace virtual campaigns and hybrid events for peer-to-peer fundraising
&lt;/strong&gt;Nonprofits have for years relied on walks, runs, rides, and other in-person &lt;a href=&quot;https://cathexispartners.com/nonprofits-guide-to-peer-to-peer/&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer fundraising&lt;/a&gt; events to boost their online fundraising. Those in-person events still have their place, but if we’ve learned anything from the disruption brought about by COVID-19, it’s that nonprofits can no longer solely rely on in-person events to anchor their peer-to-peer fundraising.
There are multiple opportunities to embrace virtual and hybrid (in-person/virtual) events and campaigns. Here are a few examples of how nonprofits have been navigating the new normal of peer-to-peer fundraising:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roswell Park Alliance Foundation moved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rideforroswell.org/&quot;&gt;Ride for Roswell&lt;/a&gt; ride to a virtual event in 2020 and is planning a hybrid event for 2021&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mount Sinai went into high gear around fundraising, including a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://giving.mountsinai.org/site/Donation2?df_id=2021&amp;amp;mfc_pref=T&amp;amp;2021.donation=form1&quot;&gt;giving information page&lt;/a&gt;, a COVID-19 specific &lt;a href=&quot;https://giving.mountsinai.org/site/TR?fr_id=1140&amp;amp;pg=entry&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer fundraising campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and a transition of their annual events to &lt;a href=&quot;https://giving.mountsinai.org/site/SPageServer/?pagename=dubingala&quot;&gt;virtual events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida has run successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feedhopenow.org/site/TR?fr_id=1270&amp;amp;pg=entry&quot;&gt;virtual food drives&lt;/a&gt; since 2013­­­­­&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put user-generated content (UGC) to work
&lt;/strong&gt;The power behind your peer-to-peer fundraising events comes from people sharing information and driving support from their networks for a cause they believe in. Using user-generated content gives you another way for your participants to share their own ideas.
For example, use a content aggregator like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.juicer.io/&quot;&gt;Juicer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tintup.com/&quot;&gt;Tintup&lt;/a&gt; to bring content to your campaign homepage via your hashtags. You can even take UGC to the next level using tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://gathervoices.co/&quot;&gt;Gather Voices&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://seenit.io/&quot;&gt;Seenit&lt;/a&gt; to gather user-generated videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you don&amp;#39;t leave money on the table
&lt;/strong&gt;You may consider your fundraising campaigns a success, but you may also be leaving valuable funds on the table without even realizing it. Here are some simple but often overlooked considerations you can make to be sure you get every dollar out of your fundraising efforts:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask donors to cover the transaction fees &lt;/strong&gt;— When someone donates to your organization through your online donation form, the donor is typically charged a transaction fee by the payment processor. This effectively reduces the proportion of each donation that goes directly to you by a certain percentage (often around 3%). By providing an option in your online donation form for donors to cover the cost of the transaction fees, you can capture those lost dollars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage recurring giving through a monthly giving pop-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; — When donors make an online donation to your organization, present them with the option to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/recurring-giving&quot;&gt;make it a recurring gift&lt;/a&gt;. This approach conveniently breaks up the donation into reliable monthly payments charged automatically to their credit card, which can result in donors giving more over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed a matching gift tool in your donation form &lt;/strong&gt;— Many companies offer a matching gift program to their employees. However, every matching gift program is unique and has different requirements and guidelines that a potential donor must navigate. Adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/company-matching&quot;&gt;corporate matching tool&lt;/a&gt; to your donation form makes it easier to take advantage of corporate matching programs and boost your fundraising campaign results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few tips to refresh your fundraising for the next fiscal year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooklyn, New York (August 11th, 2021) —&lt;/strong&gt; Fundraise Up is excited to announce its latest API-based native integration for Virtuous, a fundraising platform and CRM specifically for nonprofits and designed for better donor relationships. The Virtuous CRM integration is now available for all Fundraise Up customers at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new integration leverages Virtuous&amp;#39; API to automatically synchronize donation data from Fundraise Up to Virtuous in near real-time. Virtuous CRM users can now fully control how data is transmitted between the platform and Fundraise Up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we are committed to innovation so you can raise more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we observed that gift dedication had been a frequent point of friction in the donation experience. That’s why we’ve updated our tribute process so the checkout is now separate from the tribute designation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ba7a120b-f158-4471-a550-dc600661ceb2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what&amp;#39;s changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, donors would be expected to fill out all of their tribute information before their payment was processed. Putting this step before the donation could result in donors becoming distracted or inundated with too many fields to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we changed the order of the steps. Now, after electing to make a tribute, donors will only need to provide the name of their tribute, and then complete our standard 30-second checkout as normal. Once the payment is processed will they be prompted to fill out the rest of their tribute details in their donor portal, resulting in &lt;strong&gt;20% less time &lt;/strong&gt;spent completing their dedicated gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;See it in action:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/6a95c7ef-8698-48f9-bb8b-4adbe124e723/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1650b677-7904-4fc4-961d-46304edb8d1d&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the new tribute process improve my conversion rates?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Our tests show a 5.3% relative increase in conversion rate. That&amp;#39;s a 5.3% increase in donations from this change alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/2bfb8949-0f50-4c5d-829e-c93d0d008d15/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. We observed a staggering 200.4% increase in the number of tribute donations as compared to the previous process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/357f1bbf-90f0-4161-8fe4-093ece343d5b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Tribute process will be rolling out for all Fundraise Up users on September 1st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features have been added as well, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/settings/emails-config&quot;&gt;a new email template&lt;/a&gt; and enhanced customization.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, stay tuned for even more additions to our tribute card features — because we think —&lt;i&gt;sometimes— &lt;/i&gt;an old-fashioned letter just means more than an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, it&amp;#39;s our mission to eliminate friction in the donation process and convert more visitors into donors. But what exactly is friction and where do you encounter it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether physical or technological, &lt;i&gt;friction &lt;/i&gt;refers to the resistance of motion. During the donation process, a point of friction is where the flow has been disrupted which encourages donors to navigate away from the donation page, decreasing your overall conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid these disruptions, you must first be able to recognize them. Here are the eight types of friction donors experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4ba0abe8-7f4a-49c2-9f78-3c6c678e29fb&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Too many fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field number friction is related to the number of information fields on a donation form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that gathering donor information is necessary for a number of reasons, but our studies show the more fields present on a donation form the greater the chances the donor will abandon the giving process. In fact, requiring something as simple as a cellphone number can decrease conversions by 2%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bca4568e-b8f2-42f6-923f-64f84a526e1b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the solution? Get rid of any information that is not required to process a payment upfront. If you want to gather any additional information, request it after the transaction has been completed. By simply moving the order of events, you can increase your conversion rate while still gathering the data you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=069dd788-19f4-455f-aaec-4238f6edb09c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Poorly designed field layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter the actual number of fields on your form, if it looks long and complicated to the eye the donor will think the form is long and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f7baab84-8fda-4dee-b63a-efbda39d87f8/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to reduce field layout friction is to optimize horizontal spacing. By combining form fields onto the same horizontal line, you will reduce the amount of perceived work required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just implementing this simple design adjustment you can increase conversions by nearly 40%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4c6dcccd-2b61-484e-b8aa-0c769968ae33&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Error messages from missed mandatory fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, we have all encountered form-error friction. Perhaps you miss a required field and the page notifies you right away. Or, you get to the end of the page, click next, and are required to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all friction, any disruption to the donation process leaves open the opportunity for the donor to abandon the giving process. So to avoid this, clarity is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Along with reducing the number of required fields and simplifying the layout, make it abundantly clear in the form which information is required. For example, consider adding an asterisk next to the mandatory fields within a form.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=67eb1e89-063a-40bc-818c-39bff8bf9346&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. User confusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion friction refers to the presence of any web page items that distract or navigate away from the giving experience. This means eliminating confusing web items like navigation bars, competing calls to action, distracting links, or messages not related to the donor flow while a donor is in the giving process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, participants in a NextAfter study saw a nearly 200% increase in donations by simply eliminating the navigation bar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/413684e6-e68b-495b-9435-4e81445f069f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e4a976ec-8a01-449f-8c79-b8a9bfca4ce6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Too many decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes too much choice means too much work. Front-loading decisions like covering the transaction fees, making a tribute donation, or leaving a comment can significantly stall the donation flow.&lt;strong&gt; By eliminating the majority of these fields, an organization can see a 107% increase in donations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the donate call-to-action button clear in your navigation bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add two to three sentences in the donation and ask about why they should donate to your cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the number of available gift options to four.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use default suggestions and social nudges to guide the donor’s giving decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable mobile payment options to provide the user with as many payment options as possible (in this case reducing the number of decisions since the donor’s preferred payment method will likely be present).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=dacd31db-9594-4caa-85da-5b9e80f00393&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Too many steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular type of friction refers to the number of steps it takes to complete a transaction. When a donation form is several pages long, load time — as well as field number friction — decision friction, and form error friction all come into play. It&amp;#39;s a compounding effect that only serves to decrease your conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of multiple pages donors must load through, consider downsizing to one page. In addition, nix your confirmation page before the transaction is completed. Instead, when a donor completes their payment, go straight from the donation ask to the thank-you page.&lt;strong&gt; Organizations that cut their confirmations saw a 176% increase in donations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4eef55a2-bff5-4e58-a3ce-9717e4dfa396&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Not optimized For mobile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device friction is another design-oriented friction specifically in regard to mobile devices. When a page is not mobile-optimized, donors have to pinch and zoom to navigate your page and may encounter compounded issues that prevent or slow down the giving process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since 25% of online giving now happens on mobile devices (and growing by about 20% every year), it’s more important than ever to optimize your page for these devices. &lt;/strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s one extra step that can only mean more donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=c0f7d143-43b0-4bbe-9e1f-70c3477b74c6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Long wait times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As referenced in many of the other friction points, waiting is the enemy of donations. The optimal load time for any donation page is less than five seconds, so spinning wheels and multiple pages simply discourage donors from completing their transactions. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, we found an 8% drop-off rate occurred each time a new tab or page opened, as compared to keeping donors on the same page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to beating waiting friction is to take all other seven friction points into account. The faster the process, the better your conversion rate will be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making improvements to your donation page may feel like a daunting task, and we totally understand that! That’s why we want to arm you with the most up-to-date information so you can start raising more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Findings are based on 643 organizations coupled with data from our own experiments and research Fundraise Up and NextAfter Institute.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customer spotlight: OLASTEO]]></title><description><![CDATA[At Fundraise Up, we believe that our customers’ success is our success.

&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we believe that our customers’ success is our success. That’s why we are shining a spotlight on Aaron Friedman and his nonprofit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://olasteo.org/&quot;&gt;OLASTEO&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, we sat down with him to discuss how Fundraise Up helped take OLASTEO from a self-funded nonprofit to generating enough donations to start growing their good cause. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=b08166ea-abf9-4639-8bf8-ad435a6b3be2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about OLASTEO and what it means to you personally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OLASTEO stands for “our lives as seen through each other.” Our mission is to create experiences that empower students to be catalysts for social impact. We do this by curating a roster of influential speakers, interactive workshops, and immersive trips that expose our scholars to a broad range of perspectives and possibilities. OLASTEO was founded on the idea that travel can help open and expand student perspectives. In traveling to new cities and countries, we encourage our students to experience and learn about life beyond their respective communities. We strive, above all else, to educate our students about the lived experiences and challenges that others have faced, both those before them and those from other cultures and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=a183ce40-aa6f-4669-acb0-aadb99ca0fdc&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When choosing a fundraising platform, what features were important to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on four key features when considering which platform to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Branding customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recurring giving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkout experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaign management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=69e33f17-2fc5-438e-9e26-385f89b45444&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your onboarding process with Fundraise Up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two sides to the onboarding process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Technology:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had registered and created a Fundraise Up instance, but because we were preparing to use an alternative vendor, I never logged into the platform to begin the onboarding process. Once we began using the alternative vendor, we quickly realized that their platform was not the answer. So, I decided to see what Fundraise Up had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being disappointed by other self-guided onboardings in the past, Fundraise Up’s onboarding materials and overall admin user experience were next-level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;Before I knew it, I was 7 hours deep into Fundraise Up and had a fully implemented fundraising platform with two campaigns, a customized landing page, a focus on recurring giving, and an automated, but personalized acknowledgment workflow involving our donor management and email marketing systems.&amp;#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer Service:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;The customer service experience I had with Fundraise Up is a &lt;i&gt;game-changer&lt;/i&gt;. The technology is superb, but no other software company in the nonprofit game (or otherwise) can come anywhere close to matching the level of support we&amp;#39;ve received from the Fundraise Up team.&amp;#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its culture shines externally with its focus on optimizing its product based on the realities of its customers. It&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=d3ce47e5-d28e-4168-b528-333398951a68&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your website looks great! Tell us about the process of using our platform and placing elements on your website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you; Exactly one year to the day of our initial OLASTEO website launch, we unveiled a new and improved website! Our website was designed by the amazing Alisa Olinova, in close partnership with my wife and co-founder, Ceci (pronounced Sessy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving forces behind the redesign were two-fold: provide insight into our complete programming slate with the pandemic landscape changing AND take our online fundraising presence to a world-class level. Fundraise Up Elements really drove a lot of the creativity in the updated site design from both a visual and copy perspective. Our homepage makes use of a multitude of FRU Elements, with six Image Cards being the focal point. Our recurring giving program page, &lt;i&gt;The Catalyst Collective,&lt;/i&gt; features campaign-specific FRU Elements on nearly every section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=0efce1cb-49fa-4c4b-b6e8-9009eb0fcc8d&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel you’ve been better able to connect with your donors and provide them with a more engaging experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our FRU-engineered online donation setup has resulted in many calls, texts, and emails from our donor community praising the ease and elegance of their experience. The branding capabilities at every step of the process and seamless integration with our website allow OLASTEO donors to better engage with donation-specific media and info. So, yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=6d34a1b3-eebc-4225-9cb3-4df3f13c3a48&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any special statistics or anecdotes you want to share?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;We raised $0 online from January through June 2020. Once we joined Fundraise Up, we raised $30,000 from January through June of 2021.&amp;#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=97b259f3-33dd-45f5-846f-18f3ba420a88&gt;About Aaron&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native New Yorker, Aaron has always been intensely service-oriented and is inspired by the words of the great James Baldwin - “The questions which one asks oneself begin, at last, to illuminate the world, and become one’s key to the experience of others.” He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to study abroad in China and immerse himself in a community unlike that where he grew up or went to school. After working for over a decade in the healthcare IT space, Aaron currently works as a People Solutions Leader, cultivating winning organizational cultures. He co-founded OLASTEO with his wife, Ceci, in order to create experiences for underserved students that open their eyes to the larger world beyond their immediate community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most hotly debated questions in the nonprofit sector is whether to ask donors to cover transaction fees or not. Some believe it dissuades donors from giving, while others see it as a benefit to the nonprofit itself. So, we set out to give you the definitive answer as to whether or not to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 532,665 user sessions and 481,600 individual donors over eight months to address these common questions...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-does-the-coverage-of-transaction-costs-affect-the-donation-amount-of-subsequent-donations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the coverage of transaction costs affect the donation amount of subsequent donations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of a nonprofit’s most basic goals is not only to acquire recurring donors but to see future donation amounts maintain or increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;💡&quot; class=&quot;callout gray_background&quot;&gt;From our findings, we not only observed that the first donation positively impacts the amount of the next donation, but that asking the donor to cover the transaction costs does not affect the amount of subsequent donations.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score 1 for asking donors to cover the fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;does-covering-transaction-costs-affect-whether-a-donor-will-cover-costs-on-their-next-donation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does covering transaction costs affect whether a donor will cover costs on their next donation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is yes, but it’s a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a majority of nonprofits, there is actually no statistically significant difference between donors who cover costs and those who don’t when the donation size is $120 or more. So, while the consistency of those who give $120+ may be a bit scattered, statistically this makes little to no impact on your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;however-those-who-donate-80-or-less-and-cover-transaction-costs-on-their-first-donation-are-14-less-likely-to-donate-again-when-compared-to-similar-donors-who-do-not-opt-to-cover-the-transaction-costs&quot;&gt;However, those who donate $80 or less and cover transaction costs on their first donation are 14% less likely to donate again when compared to similar donors who do not opt to cover the transaction costs.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;💡&quot; class=&quot;callout gray_background&quot;&gt;So, when considering this question, ask yourself which demographic makes up the majority of your donations. The right decision lies with them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-does-covering-the-transaction-costs-on-the-first-donation-affect-the-coverage-of-costs-on-subsequent-donations-overall&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does covering the transaction costs on the first donation affect the coverage of costs on subsequent donations overall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the demographic findings above, overall we found that donors who cover the transaction costs on their first donation are &lt;strong&gt;32% more likely to do so on subsequent donations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;having your checkout default covering costs to “yes” increases the likelihood of the fees being covered on future donations by 15%!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean for your organization? &lt;strong&gt;Based on our findings, we would advise asking donors to cover transaction costs, which is what we designed our platform to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/2f115917-27f0-40e2-bbf7-e28c61fde44c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our data-driven approach, we have found a whopping &lt;strong&gt;92% of donors cover the transaction costs &lt;/strong&gt;when using Fundraise Up which means more revenue for your good cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we are committed to expanding access to more digital wallets no matter where you live. So, we are very excited to announce that Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD) payment is now available for all Canadian customers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAD allows donors to directly connect their bank accounts and approve immediate bank-to-bank transfers. All PAD payments will appear in Stripe and are fully compliant with Canadian requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAD, due to its bank-to-bank nature, is the most popular with recurring donations. While donors can certainly use it for one-time payments, the option is not available unless a donor plans to pay $15 or more. And though it takes longer for the transaction to start, the biggest benefit of PAD is its guaranteed verification and payment clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, we’ve made sure that using PAD is frictionless and easy thanks to our partnership with Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get started by contacting your success engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:succes@fundraiseup.com&quot;&gt;success@fundraiseup.com&lt;/a&gt; or by reading the support documentation below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your nonprofit’s cause, no one has a greater understanding than you do. But effectively communicating your message to your donors can be an entirely different skill set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a marketing agency is one of the best ways to expand your reach and increase engagement with your existing donor base — especially if they are specialized in marketing for nonprofits. In a day and age where communicating to different audiences across platforms can be a logistical nightmare, it&amp;#39;s important to employ a team of experts to help you navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve compiled a list of eight superb agencies with a proven track record of lifting up nonprofits. We looked for agencies who not only know your line of work but offer hands-on services, best-in-class creativity, analytics and care about your mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, Gift Aid was enabled by individual organizations through the custom questions function, which proved to be clunky and burdensome. Now, you simply enable the option in the campaign settings and are ready to accept Gift Aid declarations during checkout or through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/virtual-terminal&quot;&gt;Virtual Terminal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 11, 2021, we will officially end support for version 1 (V1) of our Elements product. We have communicated this change throughout much of the summer, but on October 11th we will officially end support. On this date, any V1 Elements will stop rendering on the web pages where they&amp;#39;ve been placed. We recommend that any organization still using V1 Elements on their web pages swap them for current-version Elements before the 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to end support for V1 Elements came earlier in 2021 as we launched plans to expand the capabilities of current-version Elements, which included over 20 buttons, sliders, overlays, and other fundraising-centric website UI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=30c68b61-d91b-4806-bc00-d398d3327ddc&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to recognize V1 Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to confirm whether an Element on your webpage is V1 or a current version is to view the page&amp;#39;s source code and check the href tag of the Element&amp;#39;s HTML snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All V1 Elements have an href tag that&amp;#39;s prepended with &lt;strong&gt;#FUN. &lt;/strong&gt;All current-version Elements have an href tag that begins with &lt;strong&gt;#X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d8d3d2b5-f3e5-4e34-8708-09d1bddc8007/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The source code of this webpage reveals that a V1 Element is in use. Note the #FUN href prepend and the Element properties that have been set directly in the Element&amp;#39;s code.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike current-version Elements, V1 Elements cannot be created, viewed, or updated from the Fundraise Up account dashboard. Instead, V1 Elements are coded into an organization&amp;#39;s webpage using the Element&amp;#39;s HTML snippet. The HTML snippet includes all of the attributes for the Element, including size, color, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=b9a162cd-776a-4ac6-a1a5-4687df50f0d1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to swap V1 Elements for current versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that any organization still using V1 Elements swap them for current-version Elements before October 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give donors more giving options and to help nonprofits meet more donors where they are, Fundraise Up is excited to announce that nonprofits are now able to accept Venmo donations, further expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/payment-options&quot;&gt;our portfolio of digital wallets&lt;/a&gt; — which also includes Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/763617/venmo-total-payment-volume/&quot;&gt;$60.6 billion transacted on Venmo&lt;/a&gt; in Q4 of 2021 alone, it further proves the validity of this popular app-based payment service. Many of your donors are already using Venmo every day to pay their bills, buy merchandise from their favorite vendors, and easily split the bill with their friends and family members for shared experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating Venmo as a donation payment option is simple and takes seconds to set up. We process Venmo donations through PayPal, so you have to connect your PayPal account to your Fundraise Up account. Then, you just have to enable Venmo on the payment options settings page with one click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors who choose this donation route, there are two Venmo donation checkout options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop browser: &lt;/strong&gt;For donors who click the Venmo button from a desktop browser, the donor will be provided a screen with a QR code that they can scan from their phone&amp;#39;s camera to approve their Venmo donation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile browser: &lt;/strong&gt;For donors who click the Venmo button from a mobile browser, the donor will be taken to the Venmo app to approve the donation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once someone makes a donation through Venmo, they will receive an email receipt in addition to a push notification from the Venmo mobile app letting them know that their donation has been processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a year that posed much uncertainty, 2021 proved to be a year when generosity was at its height. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://institute.blackbaud.com/charitable-giving-report/&quot;&gt;a new report from the Blackbaud Institute&lt;/a&gt; based on an analysis of $46.5 billion, charitable giving in the U.S. increased 9%. Additionally, an analysis of $2.9 billion concluded that there was also a 9% increase in online giving. Looking at the last three years alone, online giving has skyrocketed with an explosive 42% growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other key findings on online giving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large nonprofits (&amp;gt;$10 million) saw a 9.8% increase in online giving, medium-sized nonprofits ($1 million to $10 million) saw an 8.7% increase in online giving, and small nonprofits (&amp;lt;$1 million) saw a 3.9% increase in online giving in 2021 compared to 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twelve percent of total fundraising came from online giving. While this is a 1% decrease from 2020, this is still higher than pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donations made through a mobile device made up 28% of online giving, which is on par with 2020 and a significant increase from the 9% reported in 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online donor retention was 23% for first-time donors and 64% for multi-year donors, signifying a higher percentage of donors being retained over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average gift across all sectors was $204, a 15% increase from 2020.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic sped up the need for online giving options, and these findings show that generosity through online giving channels continues to grow significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels. To meet the ongoing demand for engaging online giving experiences and to stand out in a crowded marketplace, your nonprofit needs to modernize its online giving experience, ensuring that it is attractive enough to catch the attention of new donors and seamless enough so that giving can be done in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;online-giving-should-be-an-integrated-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online giving should be an integrated experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrbenchmarks.com/charts/web-engagement&quot;&gt;79% of website visitors who have the intention of giving end up abandoning the donation page?&lt;/a&gt; This staggering statistic is attributed to a complicated and time-consuming donation process. Your donors don’t want to spend time filling out a lengthy donation form with a slow load time. With today’s quick-moving online experience — like being able to preorder your favorite coffee from Starbucks and checkout on the mobile app within seconds — any page that takes more than a few seconds to load will lose your donor’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data experts, we know that the industry standard for fully loading a webpage is &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/page-speed-stats&quot;&gt;more than 10 seconds.&lt;/a&gt; With Fundraise Up, that time drops significantly to 1.5 seconds. That’s why we believe that standalone donation forms and donation pages are a thing of the past. Why should you disrupt your donor’s experience by redirecting them to another webpage? Instead, streamline the donation experience by including an embeddable modal that appears front and center on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To integrate your donation experience for your visitors, it’s important to add multiple call-to-action elements to your website. That way, your visitors can focus on taking action instead of fumbling around looking for a hidden donate button. For example, when a visitor goes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfbnj.org/?form=donate&quot;&gt;Community FoodBank of New Jersey’s website&lt;/a&gt;, they are immediately prompted to give with a donation modal. But if they exit the modal to learn more about the organization and explore ongoing fundraising campaigns, there are multiple call-to-action prompts strategically placed throughout the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/92d5f7ed-0fb6-4fbb-bd31-a4b5b8790b91/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;create-an-inclusive-movement-around-online-giving&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an inclusive movement around online giving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want your donor experience to feel bigger than just a donation. Your mission exists for a higher purpose than just “doing social good” — perhaps you’re a community-led organization that works tirelessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/international-anti-poaching-foundation&quot;&gt;to save the lives of endangered species from poachers,&lt;/a&gt; for example — so you want to encourage your donors to be evangelists for your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to create these evangelists is by highlighting your monthly giving program in a prominent location on your website. Make that section stand out from the rest of your website, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.org/&quot;&gt;Greater Good Charities’ Protector program.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f83b5e02-f8a7-4f1e-aa61-9a5c3add51dd/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee that your website visitor will sign up for your monthly giving program just because you’ve caught their attention. Once you have their attention with a visually appealing monthly giving call to action, you now have to move them to sign up as a recurring donor with a captivating message. In a few sentences, explain why you need their support and how much their support would make a world of a difference for your mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the messaging brief and to the point to ensure the visitor&amp;#39;s focus is primarily on the “Give Monthly” call to action. But be sure to include a link to your monthly giving page, where visitors can find the full scope of the program if they are looking for it like Greater Good Charities has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with Fundraise Up, once people sign up as monthly givers, they get immediate access to &lt;a href=&quot;/6e76cb97a5e441fa89f06330c0b81e85&quot;&gt;the Donor Portal,&lt;/a&gt; giving them a simple way to manage their giving plans, peer-to-peer fundraisers, and year-end tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has exponentially enhanced the way people interact with organizations. The good news is that today’s consumer experience is now personalized down to every delicate detail — like being able to order your usual meal from the nearby sushi restaurant and pay with your preferred payment method on your favorite food delivery app. The bad news is that many nonprofits are not matching these consumer experiences, leading to not-so-great donor experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective way to easily improve the donation experience is to offer a diverse suite of donation payment options. This vastly expedites the donation checkout process and converts more potential donors into actual donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow us along in this blog as we uncover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding your donors’ giving preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiating types of donation payment options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting more donors with better donation payment options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;your-donors-giving-preferences&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your donors’ giving preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No two donors are alike: Each individual donor has unique interests and patterns of giving, so it’s prudent that your nonprofit recognizes that. One thing you never want to do is lump your donors into one given category. For example, just because everyone has a credit card doesn’t mean that’s their preferred way to pay. If you want to truly connect with your donors, it’s important to understand that they have different giving preferences. To give you more insight, we’ll share quick profiles of the two biggest generational givers: Millennials and Baby Boomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1bffe6bc-ea82-40e7-b3fa-d2c4d376192c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millennials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millennials, once referred to as the “Lost Generation,” are coming into purview as the next powerful generation of donors. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/#:~:text=Millennials%20were%20the%20largest%20generation,the%20population%20for%20many%20years.&quot;&gt;more than 72 million Millennials in the U.S.,&lt;/a&gt; with 84% giving to charitable causes annually. While Baby Boomers still hold the majority of wealth, Millennials are reaching peak earning years and could receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-millionaires-baby-boomer-inheritance-wealth-transfer-2019-10&quot;&gt;up to $68 trillion from their Baby Boomer parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These digital natives — those who grew up using technology — are likely to give online and through their mobile device, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/&quot;&gt;93% of Millennials owning a smartphone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/infographic-73-of-millennials-use-their-phones-to-shop-online/&quot;&gt;73% using their phones to shop online&lt;/a&gt;, which can be comparable to online giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=30e4065a-044f-4252-92ad-5455e99ad905&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby boomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As no surprise, Baby Boomers currently hold the title for the wealthiest generation. According to Federal Reserve data, Americans ages 70 and older had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/older-americans-35-trillion-wealth-giving-away-heirs-philanthropy-11625234216#:~:text=Baby%20boomers%20and%20older%20Americans,from%2020%25%20three%20decades%20ago.&quot;&gt;a net worth of nearly $35 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2021. Because of the digital state in which they grew up in, many think this generation of digital immigrants (those who did not grow up using technology and had to adapt) struggle with adopting technology, but Baby Boomers are very adept at using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/1868764/The%20Rise%20in%20Digital%20Adoption%20Among%20Baby%20Boomers.pdf?__hstc=232285504.ed48326ac2422eed9f5b77aa8ab01d72.1609276768191.1609276768191.1609276768191.1&amp;amp;__hssc=232285504.1.1609276768192&amp;amp;__hsfp=3259168925&quot;&gt;85% want more digital options,&lt;/a&gt; 80% feel confident and comfortable using technology, 78% feel safe and secure using new technologies, and 77% enjoy using new technologies. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fisglobal.com/en/insights/merchant-solutions-worldpay/article/generation-pay-baby-boomer-payment-trends&quot;&gt;49% of Baby Boomers&lt;/a&gt; like to stay up to date with the latest payment methods, 57% find it easier to pay using contactless methods, and 45% agree that mobile wallets make it easier to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, the use of digital wallets is on the rise. To meet the increased demand for modern payment methods, it should be standard practice to offer a growing library of donation options to cater to every type of donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;types-of-donation-payment-options&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of donation payment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s modern world allows nonprofits to accept multiple forms of payment options, giving people the power to donate to their favorite nonprofits however they want. As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewaterproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Water Project&lt;/a&gt; gives its donors the option to give through a credit card, digital wallet (Google Pay, PayPal, Click to Pay), or bank transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/386500c5-c770-484f-bea5-5a37a7437121/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a nonprofit, it can be difficult to stay on the pulse of a constantly changing environment. Not to fret — here is a quick breakdown of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/payment-options&quot;&gt;payment options&lt;/a&gt; currently available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit cards. &lt;/strong&gt;Perhaps the most popular, credit cards are accepted domestically and internationally. Most online giving platforms accept VISA, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Discover, UnionPay, and Diners Club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank transfers. &lt;/strong&gt;This type of payment method caters to those who prefer to have funds taken directly from their bank account. Services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://plaid.com/&quot;&gt;Plaid&lt;/a&gt; make it simple for donors to electronically transfer money from their bank account to your nonprofit’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital wallets. &lt;/strong&gt;Also known as e-wallets, digital wallets store payment information to expedite online checkouts. A number of digital wallets are widely available: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Click to Pay, PayPal, and Venmo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrency. &lt;/strong&gt;In 2021, Fidelity Charitable accepted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/insights/2022-giving-report.html&quot;&gt;a record $330 million in cryptocurrency assets&lt;/a&gt;. With the growing popularity of cryptocurrency, this form of payment helps nonprofits reach those high-net-worth individuals who give larger gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks. &lt;/strong&gt;With appreciated stock representing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nonprofitpro.com/post/transform-charitable-giving-by-accepting-donated-stock/&quot;&gt;$100 billion in untapped funding&lt;/a&gt; and advantages to donating stock vs. selling it (like paying no capital gains taxes), many high-net-worth donors will be looking to give this way to their favorite charities, especially with giving platforms like Fundraise Up simplifying the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an online giving platform that offers all of the aforementioned donation payment options to choose from can be one in a million. However, as technology enthusiasts, we understand how important it is to cater to every single one of your donors. Fundraise Up is constantly adding new payment methods to our pipeline — like the recently available &lt;a href=&quot;/5018ae7429a34e71836763e2ba63f96f&quot;&gt;Venmo&lt;/a&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;bottom-line-better-donor-conversions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line: better donor conversions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we analyzed data from January 1, 2021 to September 1, 2021 to understand &lt;a href=&quot;/85f501a064be43b784745f5b19ec0688&quot;&gt;what types of payment methods our nonprofits’ donors used.&lt;/a&gt; While credit cards remained the most popular form of donation payment (65%), donors also used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PayPal: 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Pay: 6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Pay: 3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plaid: 0.34%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more payment options you offer, the better your donor conversion rate. Imagine if you didn’t offer PayPal: You could be losing 25% of those donors who would have otherwise donated with a PayPal checkout option. Instead, the only available option was to pay with a credit card, but the donor didn’t have their credit card immediately available. Because of that, the donor never returned to complete the checkout, forcing your nonprofit to lose out on a valuable donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href=&quot;/633a4d5e2b64448f82e205a4449c331c&quot;&gt;donor conversion rises by 10%&lt;/a&gt; when PayPal is offered as a donation payment option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let a simple upgrade keep you from getting the donations you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A holiday dating back to the women’s suffrage movement in the early 1900s, IWD is celebrated annually to highlight the achievements of women all over the world, as well as to bring together activists, advocates, and allies to continue the fight for women’s rights, gender equality, and gender equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Economic Forum’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2021/digest&quot;&gt;“Global Gender Gap Report 2021,”&lt;/a&gt; the worldwide average distance to parity is 68%, a step back from 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic. On its current trajectory, WEF predicts that it will take 135.6 years to close the gender gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’ve made progress, there’s so much more work to do. It’s still as important as ever to outwardly recognize the gender disparity that exists and #BreaktheBias — this year’s IWD theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of IWD and to honor the women of the world, below is a list of women-empowering nonprofits you can donate to today and everyday — especially during a difficult time when so many women and children need your support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-united-nations-population-fund&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. United Nations Population Fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United Nations Population Fund is the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. With so many women and youth suffering from poor health care systems, UNFPA is dedicated to delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person&amp;#39;s potential is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits struggle with routinely providing positive donation experiences for their international supporters. Most donation platforms show languages and currencies without taking into account the donor’s browser language setting or location. Even for nonprofits investing in platforms that convert a donation to the donor’s local currency, they are forced to navigate through a page that is either poorly translated or not in their preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is changing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the release of localization for nonprofits starting March 2022. With this unique feature, the donor’s language is dynamically displayed on the buttons and labels in the donation Checkout and Donor Portal. In addition, nonprofits will also be able to translate any text they’ve customized for the donor Checkout, emails, Elements, and Donor Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that localization is not just about simple translations. Languages are translated by native speakers who account for cultural and linguistic specificities (e.g., what colors mean in different cultures, dialect variations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, you choose what languages you want to support on an account level and on a campaign basis to fit the needs and capabilities of your individual nonprofit. There are currently five available languages to choose from — English (US, UK, CA), French (CA), and Spanish (LATAM). We will continue to expand the languages we offer over the course of the year, starting with a range of European languages to accompany our efforts to launch SEPA Direct Debit and better serve donors and organizations based in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/228a7c7c-b507-46bb-b046-4029e741c9f4/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is able to detect the website visitor’s preferred language in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Browser preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom URL and javascript parameters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this localization feature allows nonprofits to reach English- and Spanish-speaking populations in the U.S., it is just one piece of the international fundraising puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization is an all-encompassing strategy that includes localizing content, automating currency conversion, offering country-specific payment methods, and using web design features that are unique to specific countries (e.g., structuring copy right to left for Arabic or Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internalization will help nonprofits create the best possible donor journey for everyone, regardless of where they come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Internationalization provides a next-generation donor experience that will build trust between you and your donors and establish you as a respected authority in the sector, increasing the odds of converting website visitors into long-term recurring supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the value of cryptocurrency on the rise, Fundraise Up is excited to announce that crypto donations for nonprofits are coming very soon. Crypto as a donation payment option is currently planned for May 2022, giving nonprofits yet another way to receive donations to help them accommodate every donor’s giving preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, nonprofits can accept crypto donations just like any other payment method on our platform, avoiding any disruption in the donation process caused by a redirect to a third party’s landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto has grown at an enormous rate within the past few years — with the value of Bitcoin growing from $0.09 in July 2010 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp&quot;&gt;nearly $69K in November 2021.&lt;/a&gt; With more than 10,000 different types of cryptocurrencies, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5505342/global-cryptocurrency-market-report-2021-covid?utm_source=CI&amp;amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;amp;utm_code=fn8pvl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1642707%20-%20Global%20Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Report%202021-2025%20%26%202030%3A%20Transparency%20in%20Financial%20Payments%20are%20Expected%20to%20Propel%20the%20Growth%20of%20the%20Market&amp;amp;utm_exec=chdo54prd&quot;&gt;market for crypto hit a high of $1.63 billion in 2021,&lt;/a&gt; and it’s projected to grow to $2.73 billion by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more and more people looking to invest in this rapidly growing market, crypto owners will be highly motivated to donate to their favorite charitable causes: Gifting crypto is a non-cash, in-kind donation so the donor does not have to pay capital gains taxes, and the donor’s tax deduction will be equal to the fair market value of the donated crypto asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits would be remiss if they missed this opportunity to cultivate these high-net-worth individuals. Many nonprofits, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/unicef-cryptofund&quot;&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charitywater.org/bitcoin&quot;&gt;charity: water,&lt;/a&gt; understand the value in these donors and have already begun accepting crypto donations. To put the value of a crypto donor into context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/insights/cryptocurrency-and-philanthropy.html&quot;&gt;45% of crypto owners donated $1,000 or more&lt;/a&gt; to charities in 2020. By October 2021, donors already donated $158 million to their Fidelity Charitable donor-advised funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generosity of Americans is vast, with a record-breaking &lt;a href=&quot;https://givingusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GUSA2021_Infographic_Digital.pdf&quot;&gt;$471 billion donated&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. While impressive, the U.S. actually ranks 24th in a long list of the world’s most generous countries in donating money — with Indonesia, Myanmar, and Australia leading the way — according to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2021-publications/caf-world-giving-index-2021&quot;&gt;CAF World Giving Index 2021.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to shame the U.S. in its giving but to show that the donor pool for nonprofits is much deeper than you might think. Do a quick Google search, and you’ll find that there is no shortage of general fundraising how-to resources for U.S. nonprofits. However, international fundraising is a topic that is quite underserved in our market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International fundraising is an opportunity for your nonprofit to break into untapped donations not yet explored, and we want to share insights on how you can reach these people who also have the capacity to give, transforming the way your nonprofit raises funds to create the most impact for its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you break into the international market, this is what you can expect to learn in this guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What your nonprofit can do to effectively reach international donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can create a superior giving experience no matter where the donor resides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to know about international tax regulations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;reimagine-international-fundraising&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reimagine International Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you even consider taking your fundraising abroad, your nonprofit’s mission needs to resonate with those who live overseas — like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicefusa.org/&quot;&gt;UNICEF’s mission&lt;/a&gt; of working to save children’s lives in over 190 countries or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spcai.org/about/mission-vision-values&quot;&gt;SPCA International’s mission&lt;/a&gt; of advancing safety and well-being of animals all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, a worthy mission isn’t the only thing that matters. What’s equally as important is ensuring your visitor’s website experience isn’t disrupted by a language barrier. Currently, nonprofits that are fundraising internationally provide donation experiences that are limited to single languages, or these organizations are forced to manually update and hardcode webpages that take up much-needed time, money, and expertise. And sometimes, nonprofits invest in a solution that is able to convert giving amounts to the donor’s local currency but donors are then forced to navigate through a page that is either poorly translated or not in their preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this can be a slippery slope to navigate, the missing piece of the puzzle that can make a big difference in reaching more international donors is localization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-key-to-unlocking-global-generosity-localization&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Key to Unlocking Global Generosity: Localization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest misconception about localization is that it’s just basic translation, but localization’s capabilities go so much deeper than that. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://eriksen.com/general/what-is-localization/&quot;&gt;Eriksen Translations,&lt;/a&gt; localization is the process of fully adapting content to the cultural and linguistic preferences of a specific place, which includes the translation and cultural adaptation of websites and multimedia. More importantly, localization creates an experience that looks and feels as if the product or service was created for and created by a target market, regardless of the native language, cultural preferences, or geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization also takes into account important web design features that are unique to specific countries — like structuring copy right to left for Arabic or Hebrew or &lt;a href=&quot;https://eriksen.com/marketing/color_culture/&quot;&gt;avoiding the color green&lt;/a&gt; in China or Indonesia because of its negative connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at Fundraise Up like to refer to this immersive donor journey as internationalization, which takes the idea of localization but evolves it into a more comprehensive experience so when someone visits a nonprofit’s website, there are absolutely no interruptions in their experience. With internationalization, the website is already set in the visitor’s native language and in their home currency, with country-specific payment methods displayed at the donation checkout (e.g., using Bacs for Direct Debit in the UK. vs. using Plaid for Instant ACH for U.S. residents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see internationalization in action, take a look at this example of how website content can be tailored for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ropsi.org/?__hstc=63523760.80d400506691500103d46ec16ec6a5aa.1651584564756.1655330224090.1655385817368.74&amp;amp;__hssc=63523760.3.1655385817368&amp;amp;__hsfp=1353873515&quot;&gt;English-speaking donors&lt;/a&gt; (top) and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://ropsi.org/es/?__hstc=63523760.80d400506691500103d46ec16ec6a5aa.1651584564756.1655330224090.1655385817368.74&amp;amp;__hssc=63523760.3.1655385817368&amp;amp;__hsfp=1353873515&quot;&gt;Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/a&gt; (bottom):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A memorable donor experience has become an increasingly important focus for nonprofits. It’s how nonprofits distinguish themselves in a highly competitive market. With &lt;a href=&quot;/85f484e9634645bd8e264cef29f65064&quot;&gt;online giving continuing to show steady growth year after year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/number-of-nonprofits-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Center,fraternal%20organizations%20and%20civic%20leagues.&quot;&gt;the growing number of nonprofits&lt;/a&gt; saturating the sector, nonprofits now have to think beyond having a good mission — they have to work even harder to create a seamless and optimized giving experience to ensure their donor conversions continue to grow over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing quality internationalization practices will give nonprofits the competitive edge they need, allowing them to broaden their reach and cultivate new donors from all over the world. If your website is not translated or designed for the visitor based on their browser preference or geographic location, you’re forcing them to figure out how to translate the text to their preferred language on their own. Perhaps unintentional on your organization’s part, this can disrupt the donation experience and cause donation abandonment. Instead, employ internationalization to create a new and improved experience where all of your website elements match your donor&amp;#39;s cultural preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/20852676-110d-4034-89ba-eb95fc8d38d2/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, you can give everyone &lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;the donation experience they deserve&lt;/a&gt; by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing from a variety of languages to customize messaging throughout your website, donation checkouts, and emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepting up to 135 local currencies that are automatically adjusted based on the visitor&amp;#39;s geographic location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering region-specific payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating localization of text in the donation Checkout and the self-serve Donor Portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing text on ask pages, call-to-action-buttons, and emails, giving you full control of your nonprofit’s messaging and voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending country-compliant receipts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;establish-uniformity-for-affiliated-nonprofits--member-organizations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish Uniformity for Affiliated Nonprofits &amp;amp; Member Organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For larger organizations that manage multiple entities — like a nonprofit with international chapters or a community foundation that raises and donates money to both domestic and international nonprofits — it can be cumbersome to find a streamlined process that gives a holistic view into each entity’s fundraising operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we understand that managing multiple organizations can be a big undertaking and can often cause much frustration for the overarching organization. To ease the operational burden for these nonprofits, we offer an intuitive subaccount structure that allows organizations to manage all of their entities under one account in one platform, giving the main account full visibility in all subaccount fundraising and donation activities. As an added bonus: This also gives organizations an opportunity to have full control over each organization’s look and feel, allowing them to create uniform branding across all of the nonprofit websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;adhere-to-gdpr-standards&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adhere to GDPR Standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While accepting international donations is a great way to grow your fundraising pipeline, remember that it’s just as important to adhere to best data practices, especially for those who are residents of the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation protects EU residents from unethical data collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because your nonprofit isn’t located in the EU doesn’t mean that GDPR doesn’t affect you. Quite the contrary: You need to adhere to GDPR for any EU resident visiting your website. Not complying with GDPR will result in shelling out much-needed money for fines that should otherwise go toward your mission. To ensure your nonprofit is compliant with GDPR standards and you’re not putting yourself at risk, here are some quick tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluate your current data collection practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct an audit on your existing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train your staff on GDPR best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your privacy policy to communicate with your donors what data you’re collecting and how you’re using their data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t hold onto data about EU residents for longer than you have to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure EU residents are opting into every communication piece they receive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay up to date with GDPR and any updates that come down the road&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;comply-with-international-tax-regulations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comply With International Tax Regulations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rising concern for accepting international donations is understanding and complying with country-specific tax regulations. And because rules and regulations for tax-deductible donations vary from country to country, it could be difficult for nonprofits to stay compliant with each one, especially if they don’t have a legal specialist on staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, if someone is interested in making a gift but wants confirmation that their gift is tax-deductible for their resident country, nonprofits should never make any promises unless they are familiar with the tax rules of that country. Instead, nonprofits should suggest that the donor seek legal guidance on tax deductibility. However, while you can’t promise that their gift is tax-deductible, you can take measures to ensure that they receive country-compliant tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To alleviate any of the headaches of manually sending your donors — including the international ones — individualized tax receipts but still ensuring that you’re providing all of your donors with a top-notch giving experience, Fundraise Up automatically sends country-compliant tax receipts to all of your donors. As an added layer of personalization: Your donors can access all of these receipts and manage their donation and fundraising activity in Fundraise Up’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/donor-portal&quot;&gt;Donor Portal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your donors no longer have to manually drag charitable tax receipts into a dedicated folder in their email inbox or print individual receipts to store them in a folder in their home office. Plus, you can localize the Donor Portal so the messaging is updated to the donor’s native language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/number-of-nonprofits-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Center,fraternal%20organizations%20and%20civic%20leagues.&quot;&gt;more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., people looking to donate have no shortage of charitable causes to choose from. While the value and impact of your mission are usually top of mind when someone comes to your website to donate, a poor user experience can often lead to them donating less or worse — abandoning the donation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’ve invested in the technology to streamline the donation process and eliminate friction points like slow load times, donation form redirects, and generic giving levels, there is another critical point of friction that you might not have considered: the visitor’s language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The generosity of Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How localization can help your nonprofit reach more Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of a nonprofit using localization to customize the donor experience for Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e989a82b-cfa2-4d8e-852d-70c125248266&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The generosity of Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Language%20Spoken%20at%20Home&amp;amp;tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1601&quot;&gt;more than 41 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-spanish-and-where-is-it-spoken&quot;&gt;more than 450 million people in the world who speak Spanish,&lt;/a&gt; Spanish is the second most spoken language nationally and globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nonprofit, it’s time to reevaluate your donor experience to ensure that you’re not leaving out your Spanish-speaking supporters. Latinos are known for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.philanthropy.iupui.edu/2018/09/19/hispanic-philanthropy-and-the-moral-imagination/&quot;&gt;their loyal generosity&lt;/a&gt; and are a valuable segment of donors for nonprofits to connect with. For example,  St. Jude Children&amp;#39;s Research Hospital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/st-jude-childrens-research-hospital-raises-record-4-6-million-during-national-radio-event-with-univision-300802463.html&quot;&gt;raised $4.6 million&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;i&gt;2019 Promesa y Esperanza&lt;/i&gt; radio event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you understand any donor segment, the better for your organization and the donor. Taking the time to learn about your Spanish-speaking segment of donors — their interests, their preferences, their modes of giving — is the key to unlocking their generosity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextafter.com/blog/5-hispanic-marketing-insights-for-nonprofits/&quot;&gt;NextAfter has some interesting insights on the Hispanic market that can be useful.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you struggle with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/four-strategies-maximize-latinx-focused-philanthropy-and-charitable-efforts&quot;&gt;tapping into the giving potential &lt;/a&gt;of Spanish-speaking donors, it might be the case that you’re not engaging this segment well enough. Research shows that Latinos are not asked to donate as frequently as other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=6e8f5090-1847-45e7-9b5b-0962a3cb5c2c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How localization helps nonprofits reach Spanish-speaking donors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/&quot;&gt;72% of Latinos&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. speak English proficiently, creating an experience built around their language preference can help you move the needle in building a stronger connection with them, thus converting them from a mere website visitor into a loyal supporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of your Spanish-speaking donors may prefer to navigate through your website in Spanish. Accommodating that preference could make all the difference in moving them to make a donation because it builds trust between your organization and the donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization with Fundraise Up is simple. Once you localize your messaging in the backend, Fundraise Up &lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;automatically localizes &lt;/a&gt;the checkout experience based on your donor’s browser language preference or based on your own website URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ff08a37a-9c4c-4ead-9a08-83411e156830/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google translates. Fundraise Up localizes. Localization is more than simply translating words — it’s accounting for cultural and linguistic considerations by native speakers (e.g., dialect variations, significance of certain colors, etc.).  With Fundraise Up, you have the ability to customize more minute but important details that make a big difference for your donor making them feel understood and seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paint a better picture, imagine an interested donor is visiting your English language website. This visitor received a direct mail appeal, and your mission truly inspired them. While they understand English, they are more fluent in and prefer to communicate in Spanish. But because your website isn’t in their preferred language, they have to find the button to auto-translate the website into Spanish. Now, their giving experience can also be in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is even if you’ve localized your website content, it’s equally important to take the appropriate steps to localize your donation checkout as well. Not having the donation checkout in the same language as your website content will lead to a higher chance of donation abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=c7334e38-6a39-412d-8e1f-5945c50845b0&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization in action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of how to do it right is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodbanking.org/&quot;&gt;The Global FoodBanking Network’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Using Fundraise Up, the organization is able to add various localized Elements — like a donation form, call-to-action-buttons, and donation reminders — to tailor its content to both its English-speaking and Spanish-speaking visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/c2740e22-66b2-4612-ac04-cca3a7d1c250/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to continually grow your supporter base, remember that a one-size-fits-all approach is never sustainable for the long term. With the growing number of nonprofits and the increasing competition for donor dollars, localization can help you diversify and scale, making it possible to reach every donor whenever they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/3cd18016-b0c5-455f-a95e-82b0a3c90a8a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate matching-gift programs are offered by companies big and small. These initiatives enable employees to request company matches in response to an individual’s own personal gift⁠ — effectively &lt;a href=&quot;/ef42053693364b4a8eacc650e8f2b102&quot;&gt;doubling the impact&lt;/a&gt; of a single donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nonprofits, matching-gift programs provide increased corporate funding, overall boosted revenue, and unique engagement opportunities with donors. &lt;strong&gt;Yet, few organizations make the most of these strategies, leading to millions of corporate giving dollars being left on the table each year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common roadblock in fully optimizing your nonprofit’s matching-gift program is donors unknowingly giving below their employer’s minimum match amount, leaving out much-needed fundraising revenue that could otherwise be used toward your mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;a-simple-way-to-let-donors-know-their-employers-minimum-match-amount&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple way to let donors know their employer’s minimum match amount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company has the ability to set specific criteria that match-eligible gifts must meet in order to qualify for a company donation⁠ — one of the most significant aspects being minimum and maximum donation amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors who work for companies with matching-gift programs — if their contributions fall beneath their employers’ minimum threshold, your nonprofit won’t receive a match for that gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doublethedonation.com/tips/matching-grant-resources/matching-gift-statistics/&quot;&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that 93% of companies have a minimum match requirement of $50 or less, with $34 being the average minimum size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If given the opportunity prior to making a gift, most donors would likely meet the minimum if they knew their donation wasn’t getting matched by their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To alleviate this problem, Fundraise Up and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doublethedonation.com/&quot;&gt;Double the Donation&lt;/a&gt; have partnered to create an effective solution to ensure that your nonprofit is getting every intended matching-gift donation with an embeddable upsell. This partnership encourages matching-gift donations by informing donors of their employers’ donation minimums before the individual hits the donate button. As a result, the donor is able to meet the donation minimum, and their gift is then matched by their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alz.org/?form=alz_donate&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Association’s matching-gift upsell&lt;/a&gt; in the donation ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/c33035c4-f6a6-4a33-96b8-290030adcc08/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s see this idea in action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imagine a new supporter, Donor A, works for The Home Depot. This company offers a matching-gift minimum amount of $25. As Donor A goes through the donation process for your organization, they select the option to make a $15 donation. When they enter their employer’s name in a search bar below, however, they’re met with an automated message warning them that their donation falls below the company’s matching threshold.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intrigued by the opportunity to get their gift matched, Donor A goes back to increase their initial donation size to $30. After submitting their gift, Donor A also secures a corporate match for your nonprofit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to your Fundraise Up donation’s &lt;a href=&quot;/ef42053693364b4a8eacc650e8f2b102&quot;&gt;upsell functionality&lt;/a&gt;, your team receives a $30 gift in addition to a $30 donation match, bringing the total value to $60 ⁠— significantly greater than Donor A’s originally planned gift of $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These donation upsells can add up very quickly, generating more and more charitable dollars toward your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donors give because they want to bring positive change to a mission they care about⁠. When they see an opportunity to make a larger impact, they&amp;#39;re even more likely to give. As a result, matching-gift programs bring positive results to the donors and nonprofits that participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While donors may not be aware of their corporate matching-gift minimum, adding the corporate-matching upsell by Fundraise Up and Double the Donation helps you collect more funding, better engage with donors, and develop strengthened business partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has never been a time when the need for technology has been greater. We’ve entered an era when technology is no longer a nice-to-have — it’s a necessity. We use technology to conduct everyday activities, like maintaining relationships with our friends and family, ordering our weekly groceries, checking in with our dog at daycare, and even giving to our favorite charitable causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are constantly using our technology devices, more and more people are voicing their concerns about their data privacy. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/&quot;&gt;79% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; say that they are concerned about how companies use their data and 81% feel as if they have little to no control over what data is being collected. As a result, lawmakers around the world have passed legislation to protect users’ digital privacy, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Protection Data Regulation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; protects residents in the European Union from unethical data collection practices. It was designed to give EU users more control over what personal data is being collected. Any violation of GDPR results in paying hefty fines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa&quot;&gt;Under CCPA, &lt;/a&gt;companies and organizations are required to disclose what data is being collected from website visitors and how it is being used. In addition, the website user can opt out of any communications at any given time and request that their information is deleted from the organization’s database.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daasity.com/post/zero-party-data#:~:text=Zero%2Dparty%20data%20is%20information,customer%20profiles%2C%20and%20subscription%20information.&quot;&gt;Apple no longer allows data aggregators and social media platforms&lt;/a&gt; to collect data from Apple mobile devices — which account for 60% of mobile device usage. For companies and organizations that want to collect data, users have to agree through pop-ups or user settings, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1234634/app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-rate-worldwide/&quot;&gt;only 21% of users consented as of September 2021.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have even noticed stagnant growth on your social ads this year. Because Apple imposed stricter rules on how user data can be collected by app-makers and advertisers, this has significantly impacted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2022/02/10/apple-meta-and-the-ten-billion-dollar-impact-of-privacy-changes/?sh=664c3f5d72ae&quot;&gt;Meta’s ad revenue&lt;/a&gt; — a cost of $10 billion in revenue this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this rising concern, many website browsers have depreciated the use of third-party cookies — small files that track a web user’s browsing history. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backlinko.com/chrome-users&quot;&gt;Google Chrome, the primary web browser of more than 2.65 billion people&lt;/a&gt;, is also planning on getting rid of third-party cookies, effective by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these changes, Google also plans on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merkleinc.com/emea/blog/google-announce-sunset-universal-analytics#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%20on,months%2C%20to%201st%20October%202023.&quot;&gt;sunsetting Universal Analytics&lt;/a&gt; by July 2023 and will transition to GA4, which does not rely exclusively on cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along in this blog as we uncover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The difference between first-party and third-party cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why tracking cookies are going away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the removal of cookies means for nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;what-are-cookies-anyway&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are cookies, anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, businesses and organizations have used cookies to collect information about website visitors. This data enables organizations to improve the user experience and craft compelling targeted ads specifically for each website visitor. There are two main types of cookies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-party cookies&lt;/strong&gt; are directly set up by the website domain, and data is collected by the domain for any visitor entering the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party cookies &lt;/strong&gt;are set up by domain(s) other than the one being visited. Third-party domains, like Google or Facebook, are the ones collecting the data about website visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between first-party and third-party cookies is how they are used. While first-party cookies are used to improve the user experience, third-party cookies are used for online advertising purposes. Sortable provides a helpful table to distinguish the difference between first-party and third-party cookies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b0a19f39-98c0-4197-9df8-c1ed34bc7450/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sortable.com/blog/ad-ops/third-party-cookies-then-and-now/&quot;&gt;Sortable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;why-are-third-party-cookies-going-away&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are third-party cookies going away?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With big-name web browsers — Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-floc-cookies-chrome-topics/&quot;&gt;already doing away with third-party cookies,&lt;/a&gt; Google finally followed suit back in January 2020. Originally planned as a two-year process, Google announced that Chrome’s phase-out of third-party cookies would be replaced by Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC). However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/google-kills-off-floc-replaces-it-with-topics/&quot;&gt;Google jilted those plans back in January&lt;/a&gt; of this year and instead presented an alternative: Topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics are what Google calls “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/chrome/get-know-new-topics-api-privacy-sandbox/&quot;&gt;a new Privacy Sandbox proposal for interest-based advertising.&lt;/a&gt;” How it’ll work is that Google determines a website user’s top interests for a given week based on their browsing history — the data collected is based solely on their device and doesn’t involve external servers, including Google servers.  The data is only kept for three weeks and is then deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when someone visits your website, Topics picks one topic per week for three weeks to share with your website and any advertising partners.

&lt;p&gt;The depreciation of third-party cookies will undoubtedly affect the way nonprofits collect data on their website visitors, losing visibility into valuable information about donor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem disheartening, there’s a silver lining: This is the time for nonprofits to move toward zero-party data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike cookies, zero-party data is information that someone intentionally shares with organizations, alleviating any stress over violating data collection practices. Examples of collecting zero-party data include when a supporter signs up to receive your monthly e-newsletter or when someone fills out a donation ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of zero-party data is that it informs you of how your supporters want to interact with your organization, what causes they’re passionate about, and how they prefer to give to your organization. As with any data collection, it’s a rule of thumb to only collect data that will be useful and help you improve your supporter’s experience with your organization — like understanding what causes they’re interested in so that you can include that information in their donor experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our intelligent AI- and machine-learning-powered technology, Fundraise Up only collects first-party data about website users that will ultimately improve their donation experience — like device type, time of day, location, etc. To learn more about how we help nonprofits raise more through data collection that’s fully compliant and by keeping donor data privacy top of mind, &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request&quot;&gt;schedule a demo with one of our team members.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Salvation Army UK reaches 49% donor conversion with Fundraise Up]]></title><description><![CDATA[A prominent organization well-known in the charitable sector, The Salvation Army UK has been fighting against inequality and transforming lives for the last 150 years.

&lt;p&gt;A prominent organization well-known in the charitable sector, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/&quot;&gt;The Salvation Army UK&lt;/a&gt; has been fighting against inequality and transforming lives for the last 150 years. With focus areas like homelessness, poverty, addiction, domestic abuse, and emergency services, the organization is committed to helping those who are in need of critical assistance without discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Emily Casson, Digital Marketing and Fundraising Manager at The Salvation Army UK, working for such a renowned organization means feeling incredibly inspired by the organization’s impact and feeling like you’re really making a difference in people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the organization prides itself in providing essential services and resources to help those in need of support, it also acknowledges the importance of providing a positive donation experience for its valued supporters. In efforts to improve its overall user experience, The Salvation Army UK began evaluating new technology solutions in 2021 to streamline and optimize its donation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an extensive search to find a technology partner that provides a better user experience, increased donor conversions, and more comprehensive and easy-to-understand data reports, The Salvation Army UK ultimately implemented Fundraise Up in October 2021. Within five short months, the organization has seen improvements in leaps and bounds in not only donor conversion but also in revenue generation and staff productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn how Fundraise Up helped The Salvation Army UK solve its biggest pain points through having:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An easy checkout process that converts more website visitors into donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for immediate crises with quick campaign setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An option that allows donors to cover the donation processing fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements that create a holistic giving experience and cuts down on admin time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;an-ai-powered-checkout-process-that-increased-donor-conversion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An AI-powered checkout process that increased donor conversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry average for donor conversion falls between 15% to 17%. &lt;strong&gt;Of website visitors who open the donation checkout, The Salvation Army UK is converting 49% of those visitors to donors with Fundraise Up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between Fundraise Up and other donation platforms is its easy-to-use user interface and unique AI and machine learning capabilities. The technology collects more than 100 real-time data points from a website visitor to predict custom giving levels for that particular person. In fact, 70% of Salvation Army donors are using the AI-suggested amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a noticeable difference in new recruits with Fundraise Up — those who might not have donated on our previous platform because the donation experience wasn&amp;#39;t as good. We&amp;#39;re seeing a real impact and a lot of good feedback from the donors about how easy it is,” Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up also seamlessly integrates with &lt;a href=&quot;/e278a39c96e24e24bfad117524e5567b&quot;&gt;Gift Aid,&lt;/a&gt; a tax benefit for charities in the U.K., which attributed to even more increased fundraising revenue for The Salvation Army UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;We saw Gift Aid adoption jump from 66% to 74.5%, which, for one of our Christmas campaigns alone, equated to an extra £27,000 just from more people clicking that button. Because of the way Gift Aid was presented to them, it was more obvious.&amp;#34;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Casson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;quick-campaign-setup-for-immediate-crisis-response&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Campaign setup for immediate crisis response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, triggering a humanitarian crisis. The devastating news and immediate need for life-saving support drove nonprofits to move quickly and provide humanitarian aid to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.candid.org/post/global-philanthropy-responds-to-the-ukraine-crisis/&quot;&gt;18 million people who will become affected by the conflict.&lt;/a&gt; The Salvation Army UK is one of the many nonprofits pivoting to offer its support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of Fundraise Up’s customer success and support teams, in combination with a very intuitive donation platform, &lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Salvation Army UK was able to quickly get its Ukraine appeal up and running within minutes&lt;/strong&gt; to provide immediate support to those who have been directly impacted by the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily emphasized, “For the Ukraine appeal, we set up the campaign in about 10 minutes. That speed definitely helped increase our fundraising so that we can be a lot more dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/672b0cae-8e87-4140-88c2-5c097faa100d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salvation Army UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/?form=Ukrainecrisisappeal&quot;&gt;Ukraine Crisis Appeal&lt;/a&gt; is raising funds to provide practical and emotional support to those who have been displaced by the conflict. To provide emergency services on a global scale such as the Ukraine conflict, the organization combines its fundraising power with a network of 131 Salvation Army organizations around the world, banding together to provide life-saving services for those in desperate need of support. &lt;strong&gt;The organization is already seeing a 75% conversion rate for some of the Ukraine-focused campaigns that it is running&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“We&amp;#39;re also attracting new donors. In the last week, we&amp;#39;ve witnessed generosity pour in for the Ukraine appeal, which is phenomenal. Fundraise Up is really benefiting our mission because we can raise more money that enables us to do more projects in the U.K.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Casson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=8bc0f6bc-a22f-43ae-8d49-db6089d0aeec&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible option for donors to cover processing fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To alleviate the donation processing fees for nonprofits, Fundraise Up has a feature that allows donors to cover the fees so that the nonprofit can get 100% of their intended donation. Because this option isn’t typically offered to donors who are giving to U.K.-based charities, The Salvation Army UK wasn’t sure how the message would resonate with its donors. But it was pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/adceac56-f83f-4c48-a7e9-a92f8743a3c7/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Actually, 59% of our supporters are covering the fees. We don’t have the transaction cost automatically checked so the donor has to actively opt-in to do that. That’s really exciting to show to our supporters that we’re being transparent about what the fees are and that they’re willing to cover them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Casson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=682030fa-4237-48c0-85dc-fc3936e954e0&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements that cut down on admin time &amp;amp; make donating easier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While The Salvation Army UK chose to move forward with Fundraise Up because of the significant improvement in user experience and increase in donor conversions, one of the surprising benefits it found was the versatile use of Elements. Fundraise Up’s Elements are interactive and customizable components you can place anywhere on your website to engage visitors with an opportunity to donate — like donate buttons, donation levels, donation reminders, and impact sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/76065e81-bb1d-40ad-ab1c-84b9ecc29be6/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#34;See, I love the data, so I loved discovering all the testing we can do around Elements to optimise landing pages. It&amp;#39;s actually pretty simple to embed on the website. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/donation-form&quot;&gt;simplified giving form&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most profitable elements in terms of the response we got from donors.&amp;#34;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Casson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What The Salvation Army found particularly useful was the QR codes. It has since been testing it out in direct mail and with its community supporters and has seen an increase in donations using the QR codes, creating a more seamless donation experience for its supporters and saving its staff time and resources. In addition, QR codes enabled the organization to directly track online donations for its Ukraine efforts, which it was not previously able to do in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been great to see people using them. Previously, a donor might put cash in an envelope or send a cheque. Now, they can scan a QR code, and that cuts down on the admin time. It takes less staff time needed on the backend because everything works a lot smoother,” Emily explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits like The Salvation Army UK are leveraging Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s AI-powered technology to convert more donors and double fundraising revenue.

&lt;p&gt;As rapid-growing technology advancements continue to transform our fundraising environment and provide donors with more and better ways to give, one thing that remains constant is the commitment of peer-to-peer fundraisers to their favorite charitable organizations. Peer-to-peer fundraising has been coined as the method for which people fundraise on behalf of their most-loved nonprofit organizations. Your biggest supporters can engage in this type of fundraising by creating their own online peer-to-peer fundraisers, collecting donations from friends and family members in person, or raising funds at a peer-to-peer fundraising event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, peer-to-peer fundraising has proven to be an effective way for nonprofits to raise funds — with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peertopeerforum.com/fundraising-guides/research/&quot;&gt;$1.76 billion raised at its peak from the 30 top peer-to-peer fundraising programs in 2008.&lt;/a&gt; Since then, the top peer-to-peer programs have become stagnant, especially during the pandemic when in-person events were at a standstill. However, in this year’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peertopeerforum.com/fundraising-guides/research/&quot;&gt;“2021 Peer-to-Peer Top 30,”&lt;/a&gt; revenue from the top 30 peer-to-peer programs reached $922 million, a 3.5% increase from the previous year — the first time since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With peer-to-peer fundraising yet again on the rise, don’t miss the opportunity to encourage your biggest supporters to help you raise more for your cause. Remember that peer-to-peer fundraising doesn’t have to be complicated — it can be easy for a supporter to take a few minutes out of their day to create a fundraising campaign and share it on their social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along in this blog as we share three simple things you need to turn your donors into supporters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A compelling message that drives fundraising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A platform that enables simple peer-to-peer campaign setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social sharing options that promote immediate action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-message-that-emotionally-connects-with-peer-to-peer-fundraisers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Message that emotionally connects with peer-to-peer fundraisers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your peer-to-peer fundraisers are your most loyal and passionate supporters. Your mission resonates with them, they deeply believe in the work that you’re doing, and they want to be a part of the change you’re creating by offering their fundraising support. This network of supporters can create such a considerable impact on your organization and how it is able to carry out its mission. Not only does peer-to-peer fundraising generate additional revenue, it’s also a strategy to boost donor acquisition and retention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: Peer-to-peer fundraisers offer their support on an ongoing basis because they feel compassion and empathy for those you are serving or someone they know has been affected by whatever problem you’re trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what drives people to fundraise on behalf of your organization is the key to your peer-to-peer success. But with the growing number of nonprofits, you’ll need more than a good cause to garner the attention your mission deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some time to evaluate your current messaging. Does it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clearly explain what your mission is and how it is serving the community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differentiate your mission from other similar charitable organizations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive urgency for immediate action?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight how much support is needed to solve your problem?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To share an example, Greater Good Charities does an exceptional job of making its case for support. An organization with a mission of amplifying good by helping those in need of support — people, animals, and the environment — Greater Good Charities shares a full overview of its mission and goals on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.org/about-us&quot;&gt;“About Us” page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/8b4c35f8-8a55-47d7-9338-4e9fa2c5d9ca/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;/af1b22afc1d2475dad5f76759aca4422&quot;&gt;Fundraise Up’s embeddable website Elements,&lt;/a&gt; the organization placed a clear and inviting donate button — accompanied by a pulsing heart — under its mission statement. Greater Good Charities also includes additional information on the page about its impact and financial statements. Providing this type of messaging not only gives potential donors full transparency into the organization, it also tells a feel-good story about how the organization’s community of supporters has helped it create life-changing impact, encouraging others to be a part of that change, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-simple-peer-to-peer-fundraiser-setup&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Simple peer-to-peer fundraiser setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your donors are feeling empowered by your work through your effective messaging, they’re ready to start a peer-to-peer fundraiser to further support your organization. But feeling ready to fundraise and actually creating a fundraiser is often set back by a lack of direction. Perhaps there is no information on your website about peer-to-peer fundraising or your designated page is too difficult to find. Whatever the case, it’s best to do some A/B testing to ensure that your supporters aren’t leaving your website at any point during the process due to a roadblock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-to-peer fundraising option should be easy to find on your nonprofit’s website, like the way Greater Good Charities has done. On the top-right-hand corner of its website, there’s a clear “Get Involved” button. Once a supporter clicks that call-to-action button, all they have to do is navigate down and select the “Fundraise” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/fbd39aa1-b93b-4c22-a509-2cf519d47ac1/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, your most valued supporters can set up their unique peer-to-peer fundraising campaign in minutes — a modern donation experience that includes AI-powered suggested giving amounts that will be tailored to each individual donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it even easier for your supporters, as the nonprofit, you can automatically populate an eye-catching and attention-grabbing photo and message, like this peer-to-peer fundraiser for people and pets affected by the Ukraine crisis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ba0597e8-57dc-4fac-b5af-8f2b7ad3f049/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, we’ll even give them their own personalized link to share with their friends and family, which they can manage in the Donor Portal — along with any recurring plans and tax receipts they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=9380b596-f833-4d32-af89-6b1d9bbb941e&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Effortless social sharing options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your peer-to-peer fundraisers have successfully launched their campaigns, encourage them to share their fundraising efforts on their social media channels. This will help bring more awareness and donations to your mission — it might even inspire their friends and family to start their own peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns with your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up makes it really simple for your supporters by including social sharing options in the final step of the campaign setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b4df72ad-2b93-4f65-bcbb-ba2357115d7d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donor maps are now available as part of Fundraise Up’s customizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements&quot;&gt;Elements,&lt;/a&gt; a library of buttons, forms, meters, and more that help nonprofits better engage website visitors. This new Element enables you to embed an interactive map on your website to show where your donors give around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ability to customize what information is shown — donor name, donation amount, donation date, and any comments shared on the donation — you have the power to show as much or as little donor information as you want. You can even customize the starting location on the map and at what zoom level the map will be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas of how to use the donor map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure impact — &lt;/strong&gt;Not only does the donor map provide you with a way to connect your community&amp;#39;s generosity, but it also allows you to measure location-specific impact. For example, if you&amp;#39;re in the middle of a city-wide initiative to raise money to provide food and shelter for those who are unhoused, you can display the donor map to showcase which neighborhoods are making the most impact. This can also encourage a little friendly competition among your supporters who might even donate more for their residing area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight international giving —&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re a nonprofit that fundraises around the world, display the donor map on your website to showcase where all of your supporters are from. Especially if you&amp;#39;re raising funds for global events like the Ukraine crisis, the donor map is a way to motivate more people to give. It also makes supporters feel really good about what they&amp;#39;re doing when they can see the impact they&amp;#39;re making as a community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance year-end giving — &lt;/strong&gt;Go big during GivingTuesday and the year-end giving season by showing off your global community. Let your supporters see real-time donations as they come through so they can follow along during the duration of a campaign. This will spark excitement within your community for the progress that they&amp;#39;re making — and might even sway certain donors to make another donation to help you hit your ultimate fundraising goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor maps are yet another way for you to add engaging, visually appealing website content to enhance your donor experience. Understanding where your donors come from could move the needle in converting more donations, especially if potential donors see people from around their area giving to your cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the internet evolves and innovates, it continues to heavily influence the way we interact with businesses and charitable organizations. Gone are the days when high-speed internet was a luxury — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/&quot;&gt;it’s now a necessity in almost every American’s life.&lt;/a&gt; As this innovation progresses, so does the way nonprofits fundraise and accept donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online giving has continued to trend upward over the years, likely attributed to the accessibility and ease of use of mobile devices, which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/&quot;&gt;now owned by more than 97 million Americans.&lt;/a&gt; The advent of digital wallets — like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Venmo —  have made it possible to make purchases on mobile devices in mere seconds. A game-changing payment option that can now be used online or in-person, digital wallets have eliminated the need to keep credit cards or checkbooks on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the growing use of digital wallets, it should be no surprise that nonprofits have looked to expand their payment options in order to attract new donors. One of which is Venmo — a digital wallet that is rising in popularity among both consumers and donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read along this blog to uncover everything you need to know about Venmo donations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding the rise of Venmo over the years and how it is applicable to nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversifying your donation payment options with Venmo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning how your nonprofit can begin accepting Venmo donations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-rise-of-venmo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of Venmo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally launched in 2009, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40400786/how-peer-to-peer-payment-pioneer-venmo-grew-up-and-got-serious&quot;&gt;Venmo rapidly gained traction&lt;/a&gt; to become the popular U.S.-based peer-to-peer payment app that we all know. Even though Venmo was acquired by PayPal in 2013, it continues to remain relatively unchanged  — many still use the app to electronically transfer funds to friends and family. However, it has since been adopted by many retail businesses to allow customers to pay for goods and services through a one-click button or a quick scan of a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining the PayPal family, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessofapps.com/data/venmo-statistics/&quot;&gt;Venmo reported a total of $2.3 billion in payment volume&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. That number has grown immensely to $230 billion in 2021. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-venmo-partnership-2022-ebay-deal-over-2021-11&quot;&gt;more than 80 million users,&lt;/a&gt; it’s become a preferred payment option for many customers, presenting nonprofits with a big opportunity to accept donations through this fast-growing digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;offer-flexible-donation-payment-options-with-venmo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer flexible donation payment options with Venmo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering Venmo as a donation payment option will give nonprofits more flexibility to meet donors wherever they are — not only improving donor acquisition but retention, too. The reality is that no two donors are the same, and it’s important to constantly remind yourself that each donor has &lt;a href=&quot;/85f501a064be43b784745f5b19ec0688&quot;&gt;a different preference for giving.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting payment methods to just credit cards and/or bank transfers can be frustrating for those who don’t always have their credits and checkbooks with them all the time. Especially for digital natives like Millennials and Gen Z &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalpayments.com/insights/2022/01/31/millennials-and-gen-z-shaping-the-future-of-payments#:~:text=Digital%20wallets%20are%20an%20especially,up%20from%2050%25%20in%202020.&quot;&gt;who have a proclivity for digital wallets,&lt;/a&gt; you won’t lose out on valuable donations if you expand your library of payment options to include a highly preferred digital wallet like Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To share a nonprofit that offers flexible payment options, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bailproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Bail Project’s simple donation process&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/22f45710-a8d6-4bc1-9e89-2b558d3aad83/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not every donor will choose to check out with Venmo, there will be a number of donors who will be excited that you’re offering their preferred payment method, increasing your odds of converting that person from an interested donor to an actual donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-to-accept-venmo-donations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to accept Venmo donations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venmo currently doesn’t support nonprofits the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/how-to-set-up-a-nonprofit-account-with-paypal&quot;&gt;PayPal does&lt;/a&gt; with its nonprofit account setup. To accept donations through Venmo, nonprofits are required to set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://venmo.com/signup/&quot;&gt;a personal account on Venmo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forces nonprofits to take an additional step in order to accept Venmo donations, but then causes other frustrations along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A disrupted donation experience&lt;/strong&gt;. Because your payment options aren&amp;#39;t all in the same place, the Venmo payment option via a QR code can be difficult for your donors to find if it’s not on the same page as the donation ask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management of numerous accounts.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though Venmo is owned by PayPal, you won’t be able to manage your Venmo account under your PayPal account. You will have to create a Venmo-specific account. This creates a complicated and siloed process for managing individual payment accounts, collecting data, and reporting on fundraising revenue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a simpler way to reap the benefits of this fast-growing payment method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;simplifying-venmo-donations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplifying Venmo donations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we understand the important role payment options play in helping you move more donors across the finish line. To help nonprofits, like yourself, convert more donors during checkout, we have worked effortlessly to expand our payment options to include credit cards, bank transfers, and a number of digital wallets that includes Venmo. We even offer 135 different currencies to help you connect with international donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up ensures that you don’t have to go through an arduous and disrupted process to accept Venmo donations. We’ve made it incredibly easy to enable Venmo as a payment option without having to create a Venmo-specific account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To activate &lt;a href=&quot;/5018ae7429a34e71836763e2ba63f96f&quot;&gt;Venmo on Fundraise Up,&lt;/a&gt; you can create a new PayPal account or connect your existing PayPal account to your Fundraise Up account. Then, all you have to do is enable Venmo on the payment options page with the click of a button. Since we process Venmo donations through PayPal, the donations go directly through Fundraise Up to your nonprofit, eliminating any need to create an account on Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors who click the Venmo button from a desktop browser, the donor will be provided a screen with a QR code that they can scan from their phone&amp;#39;s camera to approve their Venmo donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f2b8b3dc-c25a-4f87-ba8d-9f4ff4ebf19f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If donors are using their mobile device, they will be taken directly to their Venmo app to approve the donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/eae862a0-dd2b-4e5f-8f93-f78826111382/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the donation is complete, the donor will receive an email receipt and a push notification from the Venmo mobile app letting them know that their donation has been processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venmo donations are another way for your nonprofit to reach the next generation of philanthropic leaders. Plus, many Venmo donors might even be excited to showcase their giving on their activity feed, where friends and family might get inspired to give to your organization, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Fundraise Up announced &lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;the rollout of localization,&lt;/a&gt; making it possible for nonprofits to customize the giving experience for every donor regardless of where they live or what language they speak. We included Canadian French (CA) in our original batch of languages to support our neighbors to the north. Now, to best serve global French-speaking audiences, we’re excited to debut our support of French (FR), also known as French of France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other available languages include English (US, UK, CA), Spanish (LATAM), German, Norwegian, Dutch, and Finnish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to localize content in French (FR) is pivotal for nonprofits that reach donors in Europe — it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-french-and-where-is-french-spoken&quot;&gt;third most spoken language in Europe&lt;/a&gt; among an estimated 80 million people. Paired with Fundraise Up’s localization capabilities (like customizing email receipts and content in the donation checkout), we’re empowering nonprofits to reach a more enhanced level of personalized giving and nurture better relationships with donors over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re committed to expanding our localization options, so stay tuned for more languages to be released throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in implementing French (FR) into your donor experience? &lt;a href=&quot;/fc8b9398f3794ab88e4e5bd37b77da9f&quot;&gt;Read our help center documentation&lt;/a&gt; on localization or &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request&quot;&gt;schedule a demo with one of our team members.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your donors are your nonprofit’s biggest asset, helping carry out your critical mission through their support and generosity. But remember, they’re more than just donors. When they’re not supporting your mission, they are consumers who are receiving hyper-personalized experiences from their favorite brands. From effortlessly signing up for monthly subscriptions to their most-used items to paying for weekly groceries with a quick click of a button from their preferred digital wallet, this level of instant gratification is the new standard for exemplary service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this growing innovation, nonprofits are now under insurmountable pressure to provide the same level of online experiences as their for-profit counterparts but with a more restricted budget. With tech-forward businesses like Amazon and Starbucks providing the highest level of personalized and instantaneous checkout experiences, how can nonprofits compete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donation form redirects are often overlooked, but they are a major disturbance to the donor experience. To put it more clearly: If a website visitor clicks your donate button, and they are directed away from your website to another webpage where they have to fill out a cumbersome form, this is a disruption and can lead to donation abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing this roadblock can significantly streamline your donation process, creating a more seamless experience that your donors will want to come back to. It’ll put you on the map as a tech-forward organization that prioritizes the donor’s time, making them feel seen and understood. More likely than not, they’ll tell their friends and family — bringing even more supporters to your doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we will address the following reasons why donation form redirects are detrimental to your nonprofit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Off-site redirects interrupt the donor experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off-site redirects lower your donor conversion rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off-site redirects cause a lapse in your nonprofit’s branding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off-site redirects disrupt your analytics &amp;amp; tracking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-interruption-in-the-donor-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interruption in the donor experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be no surprise that redirecting visitors away from your website to an off-site donation page or form causes an interruption in the donor experience. In today’s digital-powered world, your donors are looking for the instant gratification that comes from any online experience. If your messaging on your website has touched them enough, they will be moved to take action immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an interested donor is excited to give to your organization because your mission is deeply meaningful to them. However, after clicking the donate button, they are presented with an arduous donation process that redirects them to an off-site donation form taking longer than expected to load. There’s a good chance that they’ll abandon the donation midway through to find another organization with a better donation process. Or, they might begrudgingly complete the donation, but chances are they might not come back to give again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research tells us that only seven in 100 people click a donate button, yet only one out of those seven will actually complete their donation. With such a small threshold to convert a website visitor into a donor, points of friction — like an off-site donation form redirect — are significant enough to sway the visitor from becoming a valued donor to one who abandoned their donation during checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we understand how vital the donor experience is to your nonprofit’s success. With a donation process that is fully optimized and backed by data and testing, our donation platform ensures that when your donor clicks on the donate button, they’re receiving an experience that is quick, simple, and personalized — no redirects involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a close look at an optimized donation experience in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/3e3866be-d2fe-48b2-9bda-a71bf2522505/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an interested donor clicks on the yellow and blue donate button at the top-right-hand corner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liftinghandsinternational.org/&quot;&gt;Lifting Hands International’s website,&lt;/a&gt; they are prompted with an on-site donation checkout. Additionally, if the donor exits out of the donation checkout because they want to learn more about your mission, there’s a donation reminder at the bottom-right-hand corner for whenever they are ready to make that donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the entire donation process embedded on the website, Lifting Hands International knows that its donation process is simple to navigate and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-a-lower-donor-conversion-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A lower donor conversion rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone abandons their donation during checkout, your donor conversion rate is negatively impacted. Currently, the industry average for donor conversion falls somewhere between 15% and 17%. Intrusive donation form redirects and other factors — like limited payment methods, slow page load times, too many data fields, and language barriers — contribute to a lower donor conversion rate. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;/0e9db2558cdc4fa8b62d4de957090be5&quot;&gt;our research has found that donor conversion drops at least 8%&lt;/a&gt; with off-site donation forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nonprofit, you want to do everything you can to lower donation abandonment and increase donor conversion.  For The Salvation Army UK, Fundraise Up’s on-site donation ask — paired with a simplified AI-powered donation checkout — helped bring its &lt;a href=&quot;/725b5ef3e11942979ff59ded1a326014&quot;&gt;donor conversion rate up to 49%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/82579c67-74b4-4cf1-81f9-b62c751c728f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-inconsistent-branding&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Inconsistent branding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your donate button redirecting to a third-party’s website? If so, this might be hurting how you convert new donors, as well as your relationships with existing donors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucidpress.com/blog/brand-consistency-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;Research from Lucidpress&lt;/a&gt; shows that brand consistency increases revenue by 10% to 20%,  and it’s a critical aspect of building relationships with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping your branding consistent across all channels is one of the most important things you can do to earn your donors’ trust. Any lapse in branding could cause donors to question the legitimacy of your organization, especially when asking for donations. Your donors aren’t going to care nor do they want to see that your donation form is powered by a third-party service. As a nonprofit, you want to take the credit for providing an exceptional donation experience, showing donors that you’re keeping them top of mind and that you are taking into account their time, interests, and giving preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, there’s a better chance that people will complete their donation if they know that their donation is going directly to the nonprofit of their choosing. This is why it’s so important to have your branding front and center at every point of the donor journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an example of consistent branding, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bgca.org/&quot;&gt;Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/9579c1c3-10d0-4519-abf0-473257fc6685/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential donor is reminded at every step of the donation process that they are giving to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. The organization does a great job at keeping its branding consistent — with its renowned logo, messaging, and photos reflected at each step. Plus, with Fundraise Up, the donor is kept on the same screen throughout the donation process, ensuring that each donor is receiving an experience that isn’t interrupted by a redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-disrupted-analytics--donor-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disrupted analytics &amp;amp; donor tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your nonprofit undoubtedly relies heavily on its marketing automation tool to gain full visibility into every donor’s lifecycle. However, a donation form redirect could impact how your organization is able to track the entirety of the donor’s lifecycle — especially if the redirect is leading the donor to a third-party website where you’re unable to gain insight on whether the donor is completing their donation or abandoning the checkout midway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also affects how you A/B test your donation form. Without insight into where donors are abandoning their donation, your organization is unable to pinpoint which part of the donation process needs improvement. To ensure that you have full control over your donor’s entire lifecycle, keep the experience on your website and not someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to learn more about how to streamline your donor experience without intrusive donation form redirects? Fundraise Up’s fully loaded donation platform gives your donors a best-in-class giving experience that is a cohesive part of your website and has all the bells and whistles of their favorite brands — like AI-suggested giving amounts custom-fit to each donor. &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request&quot;&gt;Schedule a call with one of our team members today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we understand the critical role &lt;a href=&quot;/85f501a064be43b784745f5b19ec0688&quot;&gt;donation payment options&lt;/a&gt; play in cultivating someone from a website visitor into an active donor. We pride ourselves in continually evolving our library of payment options to help you meet donors wherever they are and however they like to donate, instilling more trust and confidence in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our donation platform accepts all major credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers — and it just got even more inclusive. For our nonprofits that fundraise in the European Union, Fundraise Up is thrilled to announce that we now accept Single Euro Payments Area Direct Debit, better known as SEPA — a cashless way for donors to connect directly to their EU bank accounts online and approve immediate bank-to-bank direct debit transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like other payment methods on our platform, setting up SEPA as a payment option can be done in a few quick and easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable SEPA in your Stripe account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable SEPA in your Fundraise Up account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize confirmation and verification emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disable SEPA emails on Stripe so your donors don’t receive duplicate SEPA-related emails:&lt;/strong&gt; one from Stripe and one from Fundraise Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start accepting donations via SEPA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SEPA is enabled, the donor will see the “Direct Debit” payment option button during their donation checkout — as long as the donation is more than €2.00. Once they click the “Direct Debit” button, they will be prompted to provide their International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and confirm their understanding of how the direct debit payment will be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with our recently released &lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;localization feature&lt;/a&gt; that offers a number of EU languages, this addition to our growing list of payment options further customizes the donation experience for every single donor to build stronger relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in accepting donations through SEPA, &lt;a href=&quot;/da17e5a6ed934260a17f4ba1db0cbcbf&quot;&gt;read our help center documentation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/demo/request&quot;&gt;schedule a demo with one of our team members today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Russia-Ukraine War began on February 24, there has been an outpour of support from people all around the world for individuals affected by the war. Nonprofits of all types quickly pivoted to get their Ukraine appeals up and running — providing essential items and life-saving services to those in urgent need of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we sought to understand how donor behavior was affected across the nonprofit industry by the Russia-Ukraine War. To uncover this, we analyzed two datasets: one group that included nonprofits with Ukraine-related appeals and one group that included non-related Ukraine appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along as we dive into data on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How giving priorities shifted to support Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much one-time gifts increased year over year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How recurring giving declined for Ukraine campaigns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-giving-priorities-shifted-to-support-ukraine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Giving priorities shifted to support Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To no surprise, generosity from donors all over the world rushed in for nonprofits working quickly to provide relief for those impacted by the Russia-Ukraine War. When comparing the change in donation volume, nonprofits with Ukraine appeals saw a 684% increase in donations — significantly outpacing nonprofits without Ukraine appeals (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/3b8ce46f-af01-4627-a599-f4400af26645/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Donation volume change between 2021 &amp;amp; 2022 for Ukraine-related and non-Ukraine-related fundraising appeals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, as of June 2022, Candid reported a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://topics.candid.org/issue-pages/ukraine/?_gl=1*1rildl*_ga*MjAzMzY0ODgzNy4xNjQ2OTA1NTQz*_ga_5W8PXYYGBX*MTY0NjkwNTU0Mi4xLjAuMTY0NjkwNTU0Mi42MA..&quot;&gt;866 grants worth $1,090,619,698&lt;/a&gt; provided in response to the Russia-Ukraine War. The data tells us that more donors are giving to Ukraine-specific fundraising campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own research shows that donation volume actually decreased for nonprofits without Ukraine appeals as donation volume soared for organizations fundraising for Ukraine. This indicates that donors prioritized donating to nonprofits supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest uptick in donation volume for nonprofits supporting the Ukraine relief happened immediately after Russia&amp;#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Even as this volume begins to recede from its March high, nonprofits with Ukraine appeals continue to see a greater volume of giving than nonprofits without Ukraine appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/american-generosity-after-disasters-4-questions-answered-83277&quot;&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; on generosity trends following disasters has shown that there is a correlation between urgency in giving and the level of coverage given by the media for any particular event. When a disaster strikes, news outlets typically provide constant, around-the-clock coverage for weeks to months. As these types of events fade from the news cycle, giving tends subside as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor that affects spikes in giving is immediacy. Donors often feel the urgency to give when disaster strikes. Others need extra time and education to understand how their donation will be used to help those impacted by the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-people-gave-larger-one-time-gifts&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. People gave larger, one-time gifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research, we found a 932% lift in donation volume for nonprofits with Ukraine appeals, a staggering increase compared to nonprofits without Ukraine appeals. This steep jump in donation volume was primarily driven by one-time gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass social media exposure and news coverage of the Russia-Ukraine War — raw footage of people fleeing their homes and cell phone photos of bombed-out villages — elicited an immediate and empathetic response from donors. This urgent desire to give drove a high volume of giving and greater-than-normal gift sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend was reflected in our data as nonprofits with Ukraine appeals saw significant jumps in average gift size after the Russian attack. This counters the downtrend in average gift size across the nonprofit sector in 2022 (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ab9084b9-0925-4d77-9a0d-e03c38cebd88/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Change in average gift size between 2021 &amp;amp; 2022 for Ukraine-related and non-Ukraine-related fundraising appeals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-recurring-giving-took-a-backseat&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Recurring giving took a backseat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one-time gifts soared in the weeks following Russia&amp;#39;s invasion of Ukraine, recurring gifts to nonprofits with Ukraine campaigns actually declined, a contrast to the growth that we&amp;#39;re seeing in the industry as a whole (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f3c3d34e-b99e-43c1-afb9-5e46b9dccae0/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 3: Change in recurring gift volume between 2021 &amp;amp; 2022 for Ukraine-related and non-Ukraine-related fundraising appeals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we&amp;#39;ve tracked a gradual climb in recurring giving volume across the sector. For nonprofits without Ukraine appeals, recurring giving has grown consistently with an overall increase of 65%. However, for nonprofits with Ukraine appeals, the volume of recurring gifts dropped substantially at the onset of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attribute this dip in recurring giving to donors&amp;#39; desire to offer immediate and impactful gifts to organizations fundraising for Ukraine. This led new and existing donors — who may have typically given smaller monthly donations — to give larger one-time gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine War has had a profound impact on the nonprofit sector and the way people give. With emergency crises on a global scale such as this war, our findings reveal that donors tend to be more generous and act quickly in their giving, which reflects the behavior we&amp;#39;ve seen in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research also indicates is that donors prioritized giving to nonprofits fundraising for Ukraine over nonprofits that didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of whether or not to ask donors to cover transaction fees remains one of the most debated topics within the nonprofit sector. We at Fundraise Up &lt;a href=&quot;/a5cd515e30dd4f3a9f4ddd2dcf2c20a9&quot;&gt;previously &lt;/a&gt;addressed this question, and our conclusion was a resounding “yes” to asking donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently we decided to analyze new patterns in order to see if asking donors to cover transaction fees was still the most effective method. This time, we compared the behaviors of both one-time and recurring donors in instances where the option to cover fees was enabled versus when it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we decided to examine what percentage of donors covered transaction fees when they were prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/2d5c4fe7-6a3f-4285-9504-1e5c275202e9/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both one-time and recurring donors, a &lt;strong&gt;staggering majority &lt;/strong&gt;will cover the transaction costs if it is suggested. In addition, these findings remain relatively consistent across countries illustrating a global behavioral pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ef8f124e-2c7c-41b9-b7ea-aa933cd44b92/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this overall view of donor behavior is wildly encouraging, we took a deeper look at this trend based on the donation amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/7d2e9762-dcb4-432e-ac51-322914639330/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among both one-time and recurring donors, it is clear that the larger the donation amount, the less likely a donor is to cover transaction fees. However, even at its lowest end, the majority of donors are still covering the fees even as the donation amount increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b4475b01-bc5b-45d3-a1ff-191d7fea9995/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when compared to donors who are not automatically asked to cover the fees, the aforementioned decline is still &lt;strong&gt;dramatically higher &lt;/strong&gt;even at the lowest end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should you ask donors to cover transaction costs? Our data says: &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why we designed our platform to default to &amp;#34;cover processing fee&amp;#34; during checkout. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;92%&lt;/strong&gt; of donors who use Fundraise Up cover the transaction costs which means more revenue for your cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customer kudos: Rainforest Trust commits $500 million to conservation]]></title><description><![CDATA[During a panel discussion at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Rainforest Trust publicly committed $500,000,000 to conserve 30% of the planet and reverse rapid biodiversity loss]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/customer-kudos-rainforest-trust</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/customer-kudos-rainforest-trust</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/93b91c2d-3860-46db-b305-6941acd4c2bd/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a panel discussion at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Rainforest Trust publicly committed $500,000,000 to conserve 30% of the planet and reverse rapid biodiversity loss by 2030. Eight additional private funders joined this pledge — collectively promising $5 billion — along with heads of state who will enact policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This $5 billion pledge is now the largest private funding ever committed to conservation. Named the Protecting Our Planet Challenge, over the next ten years those pledged to the effort will address intersectional issues of conservation including supporting the creation, expansion, management, and monitoring of protected and conserved areas of land, inland water, and sea, as well as working with Indigenous Peoples, local communities, civil society, and governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Rainforest Trust, the private donors include Arcadia, Bezos Earth Fund, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Nia Tero, Re:wild, Wyss Foundation, and the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its founding, Rainforest Trust has conserved more than 37 million acres of vital habitat.

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to digital wallets, &lt;a href=&quot;/633a4d5e2b64448f82e205a4449c331c&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; has dominated the market since the earliest days of Internet 2.0. But the introduction of both Apple and Google Pay has diversified online payments to such an extent that their popularity can no longer be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what impact do these two payment methods have on nonprofit giving? We took a look at the behavior of donors who use Apple and Google Pay to see its impact on conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=d2fe13ba-a86e-4977-b2e4-dcd2d9ffa000&gt;How popular are Apple and Google Pay?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;/85f501a064be43b784745f5b19ec0688&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; shows that after credit cards and PayPal, Apple Pay was the third most popular payment method, followed by Google Pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e01f87b4-4e94-4e64-9172-152f467eb8b5&gt;What is the overall impact of Apple and Google Pay on conversion?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our observations, the availability of &lt;strong&gt;Google Pay increased conversion by 2.6%&lt;/strong&gt;, while the availability of &lt;strong&gt;Apple Pay increased conversion by 2%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we wanted to understand the impact of these two payment methods further by observing donors’ browser choices. Specifically, we focused on Google Chrome, not only because of its direct tie to Google Pay but because it is currently the leading global internet browser. Our findings were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The availability of Google Pay increased overall conversion among Chrome users by 4%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;67% of donations made with Google Pay on Chrome were with a mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4caebf2f-d11c-42c3-8703-3ee5dace5058&gt;What is the average gift amount made with Apple and Google Pay?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve addressed the popularity and overall conversion impact of Apple and Google Pay, we wanted to know how much donors are giving on average with these payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d57feccd-31e1-4b80-ae1a-1b6bb0affab3/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our observations, the presence of Apple and Google Pay is more impactful with donors who give less than $80. This is additionally &lt;a href=&quot;/85f501a064be43b784745f5b19ec0688&quot;&gt;supported by our findings&lt;/a&gt; that the average donation amount of Apple Pay users on mobile was $78.61 and Google Pay was $56.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of Apple and Google Pay is the most important for mobile giving. In fact, nearly 38% of donation revenue now comes from mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that knowledge, we made sure to offer a robust variety of digital wallets, including Apple and Google Pay.

&lt;p&gt;Giving Tuesday is just a few weeks away, but there is still time to prepare and maximize your impact during this important day for nonprofits. Your organization will likely see an influx of new and returning donors, each with their own engagement needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you get prepared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are our tips for maximizing your Giving Tuesday revenue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a succinct call to action and value proposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know many nonprofits run a number of campaigns with specific designations. But at the end of the day, these different campaigns all serve your organization’s mission statement. Your overall mission is the value that draws donors in: so put that message front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bc473448-0a4e-4afc-8777-0e88a057d183/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at the e-commerce example above, we can observe two things that make an effective visual proposition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A simple, clear line of copy that illustrates the &lt;i&gt;value proposition &lt;/i&gt;of the product or service. In this case, Citi Bike is proposing that the key to experiencing New York City and all it has to offer is with this bike-share service. It appeals not only to locals who can “unlock” more of the city by avoiding mass transit but also to visitors who want to immerse themselves in the culture of NYC. The value in this case is immersive, independent travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A concise &lt;i&gt;call to action&lt;/i&gt;. A call to action (or “CTA”) is the prompt that gets consumers to engage with the brand in question. It can be something as direct as “swipe up to shop,” or in the case of the example above, implied, as you will want to rent a bike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most nonprofits, the call to action is pretty clear: donate. But it is the value proposition that will draw viewers to the CTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e50b0acd-aa94-4dbb-b671-a8ccf5b8f5ef/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the example above from our demo site, Helping Hand displays the value prop. prominently on the homepage. Underneath, the subheading contains a few more details while still concisely stating the overall mission of the organization. Finally, the call to action button(s) is prominently displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/ea3c9aba54ec4263a6854b86963d7679&quot;&gt;From our research&lt;/a&gt;, the ideal amount of time it should take to convert a donor is &lt;strong&gt;30 seconds.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, it is imperative to engage donors with your mission immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design your layout and workflows around user psychology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to display as much information as possible upfront, but too much information is an often overlooked point of friction when it comes to online giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b99ae5cd-c2e1-40fc-94cd-6d9301117219/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at the example above, you may have noticed that it takes some real brain power to understand what you are looking at. You are presented with two options for giving as well as six different sets of static suggested donation amounts, not to mention a text-heavy option for assigning designations and a flat presentation overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to improve this would be to add images that illustrate the different designations therefore drawing donors back to your value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/163234fe-1b45-4658-bfa3-5b6fe7fd7259/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to keep donors engaged with your value prop. is to keep your donation form natively integrated on your site. Many donation forms require a redirect from your organization’s website. From our research, donation checkouts with a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;website redirect result in a 10% loss in donor conversion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native embedding not only allows you to retain that 10%, but keep donors engaged with your brand as per the example below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/4ac6eaad-3f8d-420c-868e-2dc6dd42e37d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to avoiding redirects, organizations need to ensure a frictionless, speedy workflow to maximize conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing your donation checkout, be sure to avoid the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/aea78f8e-a3eb-46f2-9785-a310d124d306/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4e3154ee-7726-4563-8aaf-87d4fb20cceb&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what are some ways you can improve your workflow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Create a Giving Tuesday button takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d0523a09-1f39-4eee-ba3b-be98d4efee2a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Create a Giving Tuesday specific campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/095d17d4-e7be-4605-9539-bd23f87d80cd/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Customize your email templates for Giving Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ea3fa008-87fb-4ef3-839a-b3615fdf580b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Use Elements like Social Proof and Goal Meter to increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/87fa595c-e6ac-4fb4-828a-716f42982c20/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up uses these best practices to maximize donations &lt;strong&gt;year-round&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is excited to announce its new update to automated emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our suite of automated email templates now includes &amp;#34;Recurring Plan Failed&amp;#34; This template is now available and auto-enabled in existing Fundraise Up accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This email targets donors whose recurring payments have failed a number of times and whose plans are now retired. Organizations can set and control how many times a payment will be retried before the plan will go into failed status and payment retries will cease. Once the donor reaches this number, they will then be sent an email that their recurring plan will no longer be processed unless they provide updated payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all of our donor-facing email templates, the subject line, heading, and content of this email can be fully customized to match your message and branding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to optimizing your donation experience and helping you retain more donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrestricted (or undesignated) fundraising is the backbone of any nonprofit organization. These funds not only help you with your overall mission, but pays for your staff, office, electricity, and even the cost of fundraising itself. Unfortunately, donors are less interested in the granular details of what it takes to run a nonprofit than they are in the emotional engagement of your mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One only needs to look at the statistics for campaign designations to understand the power of specificity when it comes to donor engagement. In fact, our research shows that 54% of all funds have a designation, and an average donation amount of $122 — 12.9% larger than those without a designation. While this statistic does not necessarily denote cause, what is clear is that donors engage more when they know what their gift is going towards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we take these findings and apply them to unrestricted donations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-create-a-succinct-mission-statement-and-display-it-prominently&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Create a succinct mission statement and display it prominently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our research on website sessions and page views, the ideal amount of time it should take to convert a donor is &lt;strong&gt;30 seconds. &lt;/strong&gt;The best way to ensure donors are engaged within this amount of time is to prominently display your mission statement (or &lt;i&gt;value proposition&lt;/i&gt;) and your call to action right from the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e9d597ca-2b7a-4f7c-a45e-1b9137afa641/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at UNICEF USA, their value proposition “We won’t stop until every child is vaccinated” takes up most of the design real estate from the beginning. Their donation button is also displayed prominently in the header and in a different color to direct the eye towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding unrestricted fundraising, UNICEF very smartly incorporates a pop-up that displays a few seconds after entering the site. They expand on their mission statement and explain that less than 3% of their funds go towards internal upkeep. This keeps donors engaged with the mission while staying transparent about where their funds are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-increase-emotional-engagement-with-graphic-assets&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Increase emotional engagement with graphic assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much copy on a page can be overwhelming for a donor. Once you’ve created a succinct mission statement and call to action, be sure to incorporate your branding and messaging on every page of your site, including your donation page. This allows donors to continue engaging with their emotional attachment to your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/693be2c1-04cb-4a0a-ae47-09f4d645fc44/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-emulate-e-commerce-in-your-donation-checkout&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Emulate e-commerce in your donation checkout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donors shop online like the rest of us, and e-commerce has made web users accustomed to a fast, frictionless checkout experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many donation platforms redirect traffic away from your organization’s website and onto your fundraising platform’s website or subdomain. From our research, donation checkouts with a &lt;strong&gt;website redirect result in a 10% loss in donor conversion&lt;/strong&gt;. You can retain this 10% by natively embedding your donation form on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, keep the checkout fast with simple, sequential forms and only a few required fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/3bb2c707-b252-4380-9454-0948cc1c085f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While simplifying your donation checkout can help you see a 17% increase in conversion, it is also essential to provide a variety of major digital wallets like PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;20% of online donors give using PayPal&lt;/strong&gt;, and payments made with Apple and Google Pay only continue to rise in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, donors have not only become comfortable covering transaction fees because of e-commerce but also want to cover fees so 100% of their donation goes to the organization in question. Fundraise Up has devoted a lot of time to understand the impact of asking donors to cover transaction fees, and &lt;a href=&quot;/88d6167aabf94eeab78d5a32e3bcfff7&quot;&gt;our findings &lt;/a&gt;show the majority of donors are more likely to do so when the option is checked automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-utilize-intelligent-upsells&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Utilize intelligent upsells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From suggested donation amounts to generating more recurring donors, upsells are an important force in your donation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But upsells are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Donor demographics are essential to creating a bespoke upsell that more visitors will opt into. Utilizing AI and machine learning will allow your form to generate a suggested donation amount for both one-time and recurring donations based on the individual visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e0a90440-85d1-4aa7-80db-c78348a0246f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;5-entice-visitors-with-an-engaging-call-to-action&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Entice visitors with an engaging call to action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can save more abandoned checkouts and increase community-targeted engagement by employing the use of simple elements like a reminder popup when a donor opens the donation form and closes without completing the checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/6e4d6286-bdd6-4427-b1bf-d88be51ef9ff/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements&quot;&gt;robust suite of elements&lt;/a&gt; designed to increase conversion. We also designed our platform to include the widest range of international and domestic digital wallets, along with an intuitive checkout that takes less than a minute to complete. Finally, our AI-powered donation checkout automatically calculates the ideal donation amount for each donor based on their unique demographics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that all Fundraise Up customers are now eligible to process recurring donations with PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, accepting recurring donations through PayPal required manual authorization from PayPal itself, a process that could be difficult to navigate and potentially take months to complete. To be eligible, a nonprofit was required to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.paypal.com/docs/paypal-payments-pro/integration-guide/reference-transactions/&quot;&gt;reference transactions enabled&lt;/a&gt; within their PayPal account in order to schedule future charges to a recurring donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, through Fundraise Up&amp;#39;s partnership with PayPal, we&amp;#39;re able to extend this authorization to all Fundraise Up customers and bypass PayPal&amp;#39;s lengthy approval period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin processing recurring donations through PayPal, you simply need to provide Fundraise Up with the email address and merchant ID for your PayPal account — we&amp;#39;ll then take care of the logistics with PayPal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/d863865250244d028580353c7e6c4d97&quot;&gt;Request Access to PayPal Recurring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have requested access, &lt;strong&gt;we&amp;#39;ll notify you of approval from PayPal within 3 business days&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll then be ready to process recurring donations through PayPal with no additional steps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Displaying PayPal as a payment option has been &lt;a href=&quot;/633a4d5e2b64448f82e205a4449c331c&quot;&gt;shown to increase conversion rate by as much 10%. &lt;/a&gt;If you&amp;#39;re using PayPal, now is a perfect time to request access so you can expand your recurring donor base and empower your donors to give well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get started by referencing the support document below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits are constantly inundated with a long list of responsibilities — from vital fundraising and development operations to tedious administrative tasks. To help alleviate this burden, the most successful nonprofits have turned to adding more cutting-edge technology solutions into their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nonprofits have been making significant headway in their digital transformation, many still struggle with deciding whether to use all-in-one products or specialty tools to build out their technology stack. Paired with all-too-familiar budgetary constraints, these nonprofits can feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Especially during a time when the donor experience is compared to hyper-personalized, state-of-the-art consumer experiences, there is now more pressure for nonprofits to innovate and adapt to the new digital standard set by these well-established brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In efforts to provide donors with the modernized experiences they more than deserve, nonprofits are now seeking to invest in better technology solutions — but they are simultaneously overwhelmed by what they think is an extremely laborious process. However, adopting new technology doesn’t have to feel like a daunting task. With a little time, patience, and a well-thought-out and structured technology roadmap, adding new digital tools into your organization can be simplified, streamlined, and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re seeking to learn more about what to consider when building your technology stack, follow along as we explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A step-by-step guide to building a fundraising technology stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of technology in nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to manage roadblocks to adopting new technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of native integrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The anatomy of a nonprofit’s fundraising technology stack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ca712406-414b-4ebf-8ea7-8e0046caec1b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire implementation process of a new technology can take anywhere from a matter of weeks up to six months, depending on how fast your organization is able to do its research and commit to the new technology. Whether you’re building your fundraising technology stack for the first time or your team has decided it’s time for a complete digital makeover, there are four steps to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goal-Setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=b0a9621e-7dfa-43a6-a9b3-6b542ffa482d&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Goal-Setting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology plays an important role in the success of your nonprofit, it’s not the end-all-be-all to your biggest problems. Every single technology investment needs to be paired with a long-term strategy in order for it to be effective. Doing so will save you time, money, and unnecessary stress in the future by avoiding investing in a new, fancy technology before understanding how it’ll impact your organization. So, before considering adding any new solution to your growing technology stack, your nonprofit should first evaluate its needs and goals on a strategic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourselves the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your nonprofit’s long-term goals? &lt;/strong&gt;Perhaps you have a legacy all-in-one fundraising and CRM system that has non-customizable and outdated features (e.g., ineffective email automation or cumbersome donation form). Therefore, you’re looking to build a technology stack that streamlines and modernizes fundraising and donor outreach to increase donor conversion and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your budget? &lt;/strong&gt;Get your budget approved by the board before shopping for a new technology tool. This prevents any time and effort wasted for both your team and any potential technology partner’s team and ensures a smooth implementation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can take on the responsibility of a new technology solution? &lt;/strong&gt;One thing you don’t want to run into when adopting a new technology is having no one on your team who has the skillset or bandwidth to be the key person managing and training your team on the technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Changing your database, eCRM — or integrating the two — is a big endeavor. So, do your homework. Speak to peers about their experiences. Make sure you and your organization are ready to invest the time and the money. The benefits of having new technology are great, but only when you invest the time to pick the right one and build it out to your full organizational needs.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Natelson&lt;br&gt;Senior Vice President, Marketing, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humanesociety.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Humane Society of the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=0d05dd26-7d50-4c11-b99e-7f1e796e2427&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve established what type(s) of tools you want to add to your technology stack, it’s time to do market research. When you get to this step, you can either do this yourself or hire a consultant to help guide you through the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding where to begin researching might feel a little intimidating, but the good news is that there are resources available, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabinetm.com/mstack/Nonprofit&quot;&gt;Cabinet M,&lt;/a&gt; to help you narrow down your search. When you’ve selected three to five different options to choose from, it’s time to schedule pre-demo discovery meetings with vendors to discuss your requirements. If those meetings go well, the next step is to set up product demos with no more than three companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these demo meetings, you’ll want to include people on your team who will be key stakeholders — those who will work with the tool often and will need to be the first to get trained on the product. Having a diverse representation of your team will ensure the right questions are being asked and any notable concerns are being addressed. It’s a good idea to hold a debrief meeting with your team after each vendor meeting to talk through the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After each demo, I facilitate a debrief meeting with the project team from the nonprofit to talk through what they liked, what they didn’t like, what questions they have, and whether we should move forward with this vendor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maureen Wallbeoff&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meetmaureen.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofit Digital Strategist &amp;amp; Technology Coach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=6fd8bc09-34cb-4493-ae5e-8164b5f12dd9&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve completed all of the initial demos with technology providers you were considering, it’s time to sit down with your team to evaluate each to narrow your search down to the top one. During this process, it might be helpful to learn some red flags to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-year contracts. &lt;/strong&gt;Your organization’s technology needs will evolve over time, so it’s best to have a provider that gives you the option to go either month to month or one that has no contract at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product transparency and limitations. &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t want to find out &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; investing in a product that the technology you’ve been so excited about has limitations on what you want it to do (e.g., customization options in your automation workflow). At this stage, your prospective technology provider should have given you a full understanding of what the product can do and what it can’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No information on implementation. &lt;/strong&gt;You should have a good idea of how the new technology will get implemented into your organization. If there have been no conversations around implementation in your meetings with your prospective technology provider, it’s probably not a good sign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s on the roadmap.” &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and make your decision based on the product roadmap because there’s a possibility that the exciting feature or product might not see the light of day due to a number of factors (e.g., technical issues, funding changes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Put zero stock into whatever someone’s product timeline is because it’s so hard to predict with so many moving pieces. However, it is important to hear what the technology partner’s roadmap is. It helps you understand how they are improving and growing their product in the future.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Stein&lt;br&gt;Co-Founder, CEO &amp;amp; Chief Impact Officer, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinpond.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve narrowed it down to which technology solution you want to move forward with, you’ll need to schedule a few more meetings to gain a better understanding of the product, allowing your team to visualize how it’ll fit within your organization. Make sure you receive a full implementation roadmap so you know what to expect every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move on to the next step of actually implementing the technology into your organization, it’s a good idea to designate an implementation team. This implementation team will be in charge of fully understanding how to use the new technology and how it will be rolled out to the rest of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1071262e-caa2-4543-a7f1-150ba6bb66a7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve done all the preparation, and now it’s time for the real work to begin. This final stage is phased into two parts: the physical implementation of the technology into your system and the rollout and training of the technology to your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your implementation team should have a training program in place for the rest of your team prior to this stage. Once training begins, keep in mind that change will be difficult and you’ll encounter roadblocks along the way (e.g., system glitches, frustrated employees). However, you’ll overcome these challenges once everyone has had time to learn and adapt to the new technology. Over time, you’ll see the fruit of your efforts through improved processes, more efficiency, and a high return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;understanding-the-role-of-technology-in-nonprofits&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the Role of Technology in Nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pandemic escalating the need for technology, nonprofits have now recognized the important role technology plays within their organizations. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonprofitpro.tradepub.com/free/w_defa2139/&quot;&gt;“The State of Nonprofit Technology,”&lt;/a&gt; nonprofits not only understand the need and relevance for technology, but they are also significantly increasing their use of technology across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits are already dealt a number of challenges in their day-to-day fundraising operations. With the increased need for technology, curating the right technology stack for your organization’s needs can be challenging due to budget constraints alone. But because &lt;a href=&quot;/85f484e9634645bd8e264cef29f65064&quot;&gt;online giving continues to grow&lt;/a&gt; year after year, in combination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/number-of-nonprofits-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Center,fraternal%20organizations%20and%20civic%20leagues.&quot;&gt;a very competitive nonprofit market,&lt;/a&gt; it’s even more critical for nonprofits to invest in the right fundraising technology solutions that will help them increase campaign performance, cultivate and retain donors, and create the most impact for their missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trust is the one thing charities need to convey from day one. When someone enters your site, it needs to be trustworthy. In terms of experience — from how the site is hosted to the interaction of how people donate — if trust isn&amp;#39;t there, you&amp;#39;re going to lose people.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thivanka De Silva&lt;br&gt;Head of Digital Marketing &amp;amp; Web Strategy, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iapf.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Anti-Poaching Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing need for digital innovation in the industry means that there is no shortage of technology providers to choose from. With the option to invest in an all-in-one platform or build a tailored network of different digital platforms, it can be difficult to decide which is best for your nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/65d5f248-8af6-4126-b454-09ddae65a8c0/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=2f375f23-06b8-4752-adb5-81fe0a3a76bf&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-in-One Solution vs. Bespoke Technology Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to consider in today’s nonprofit technology marketplace. For many nonprofits, it’s easier to find an all-in-one fundraising and CRM system that has the capabilities to do a lot of the things nonprofits are looking for. On the other hand, as your organization grows and its technology needs evolve and become more complex, having a specialized technology stack of tools will leave you with less stress of having to do a complete digital overhaul when you outgrow your all-in-one system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=dacf16fd-ceb9-4925-9c0d-8a1dffc1216c&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-in-One Fundraising &amp;amp; CRM System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the small to mid-sized nonprofit or for the nonprofit that wants a quick technology upgrade, an all-in-one system might seem like the right way to go. But opting for an all-in-one system in place of a full, comprehensive technology stack has its limitations, especially for larger, enterprise organizations that have more specific and complex needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less time to implement and learn how to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More options included in one package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weaker tools compared to what is offered individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically more costly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited customization and integration capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional features included that may not get utilized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We heavily rely on using stacking technology simply because there isn&amp;#39;t a one-size-fits-all solution out there for all of an organization&amp;#39;s needs. There are three important pieces that we evaluate: 1) Is the technology the leader in the space in terms of not leaving clients stranded with problems?  2) Does the technology connect as seamlessly as possible into other technology so you&amp;#39;re enhancing the ease of use and each system is complementary to one another without much overlap? 3) Is your team using the technology you have, and if not, why not? It&amp;#39;s key to let go of technology when it turns into another page of endless procedures rather than a helpful way to tie your team together in a positive way.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Bearse&lt;br&gt;President &amp;amp; CEO, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zerocancer.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZERO — The End of Prostate Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ac6250d9-b60f-4491-856b-053b6b794bfa&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bespoke Technology Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For larger, enterprise nonprofits and for sophisticated nonprofits that recognize the important role that technology plays, a bespoke technology stack is the ideal way to invest in technology. By hand-selecting every piece in your technology stack, you’re ensuring that they’re compatible with one another and that you’re choosing the best-in-class solution for your every need. While a bespoke technology stack can take much more time and effort, it’ll create a more streamlined workflow over time, save you money, and help you increase fundraising revenue in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top-of-the-line technology solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better price for its value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More native integrations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More time needed to research, evaluate, and implement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ce4d88e1-5228-4e41-9d4a-39ba7fb12fd3/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;roadblocks-to-adopting-new-technology--how-to-cope&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roadblocks to Adopting New Technology &amp;amp; How to Cope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting new technology into your organization is no easy feat. The entire implementation process takes a lot of time and effort — plus, you’ll also encounter a slew of challenges along the way that can feel overwhelming to navigate. However, this is where being prepared ahead of time with a strategic roadmap will help you navigate these challenges with flying colors. Here are the top three roadblocks to adopting new technology and our advice on how to cope with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=07e746ad-2bf2-49a5-a776-cd7f6a55bf64&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convincing Executive Leadership &amp;amp; Board Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the biggest challenge is convincing your decision-makers to buy into a new technology solution. The hesitation often stems from having a limited budget, understanding how much of a difference the new solution will make, and creating organization-wide change. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before even broaching the topic of new technology, it’s vital that you do the grunt work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the challenges your fundraising team is facing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide explicit details of how new technology can create a more efficient process and solve your biggest challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share examples of how this solution has been used at similar nonprofits and how they’ve benefited from it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The key question is always: &amp;#39;Does this raise additional revenue?&amp;#39; However, part of the case should be, &amp;#39;Does this solve our problem?&amp;#39; That’s an opportunity to explore but also to help people understand that it is a future-proofing exercise as well.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Shim&lt;br&gt;Director, Digital Strategy &amp;amp; Transformation, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pathwaystoeducation.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathways to Education Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to crafting a compelling case for a new technology solution, it’s vital to appoint your team of digital champions — these individuals have recognition at your nonprofit, and their opinions are valued among your executive and board members. Your team of champions will supplement your strategic plan by further explaining the need for digital solutions and connecting how it will affect your organization’s bottom line (positively) over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=788091e7-3861-4228-ac60-e877b4112e35&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacking Staff or Expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary concerns executive leadership and board members raise is whether or not they have the required resources to manage a new technology solution. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2nd-edition-nonprofit-trends-report-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;a Salesforce study&lt;/a&gt; finds that 93% of nonprofits state that a lack of IT or technical staff is a challenge to their organization’s adoption of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge can be tricky, especially if your nonprofit is already running tight on staff. However, the implementation of the right suite of digital solutions can create a more efficient workflow and free up staff time to focus on more mission-critical tasks. This is where putting together your technology implementation team in advance will pay off. With a strategic plan, your champions, and an implementation team prepped and ready to go, you will already have a structure in place once you get the green light to start evaluating software providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=9b223c9a-170e-4740-b9e6-c993349f4308&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Resistance to Change Within the Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you’ve taken the time to research and educate your team about the overall impact a new technology can have on your organization’s workflow and processes, you’re always going to have pushback. The reality is that while your previous technology may not have been the most effective, your staff was comfortable using it. Implementing a new technology system means that they have to go through the training process all over again, which takes countless hours and a lot of staff frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Communication is the key to most things, and it is certainly the key to successful change management. Most negative reactions come out of fear of the unknown. Bringing your team along with what is going on, why it is going on, and any timelines for change can go a very long way.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Natelson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is where your strategic plan comes into play. People may not like change, but ensuring you’re providing the right answers to their questions will help alleviate their stress. Plan ahead so that you’re prepared for their concerns when the time comes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why your team&amp;#39;s workflow is changing and the benefits of the new digital tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to staff feedback, and make sure they know they’re being heard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasize to your staff that the transition will be comfortable. Explain that there will be a dedicated team taking the lead on training and that they will have ample time to learn and adapt to the new system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“People don’t like change, and we expect to learn things quickly. When we need more than just a day or two to learn new technology, we think there’s something wrong with us or the system is the problem (instead of being patient and giving ourselves enough time to practice these new skills). Give yourself and your team six weeks using the new system, and you should be pleasantly surprised by the progress you’ve made.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maureen Wallbeoff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5e7db0b6-be9b-4a14-aa85-8cb59db62544/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-power-of-native-integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Native Integrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having top-notch capabilities to improve your fundraising workflow is one of the most important aspects of finding new technology, another is making sure the new solution is able to natively integrate with your existing system. This ensures that your databases are synced so that you have the most up-to-date information available on your supporters and their activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Create a data flow map for all of your platforms. You don’t have to be a database or IT expert to know where the data needs to go.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Becker&lt;br&gt;Founding Partner, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cathexispartners.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathexis Partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can export and upload your data via CSV files, but that takes a scrupulous amount of manual time and labor that otherwise could be automated. If your current systems don’t natively integrate with the new solution that you’re bringing on, you can always use a third-party service like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/e10c1091-6e85-4295-a1d2-dd0850a1408c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-anatomy-of-a-nonprofits-fundraising-technology-stack&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Anatomy of a Nonprofit’s Fundraising Technology Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we&amp;#39;ll share the ideal technology stack for nonprofits, as well as include a number of key solutions that we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CRM/DMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraising&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Online donations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peer-to-peer fundraising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matching-gifts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email marketing/marketing automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donor intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landing page builder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment Processor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connectivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f556e39c-9e41-44a5-b1a3-aacf64744e70/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=09d19998-0a8b-4b8b-a02c-397cd08b1c45&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRM/DMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A constituent relationship management system is often synonymously used with a donor management system. In essence, a CRM system stores important data to give a nonprofit full visibility into interactions with donors to maximize relationships with them — with the ability to track interactions with donors throughout their entire lifecycle, whether through marketing, sales, customer success, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking for a CRM, make sure you’re looking for a tool that clearly organizes critical data — like donor information, individual campaign performance, donation volume, and number of recurring plans. In addition, it’s also vital to have flexible capabilities like customization, automation, and the creation of workflows, empowering nonprofits to grow and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We previously mentioned the importance of integration when introducing a new digital solution into your technology stack. In many cases, data can flow in and out of your existing technology into the new one, creating a seamless integration process.

&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is working directly with Mastercard to provide nonprofits with clear guidance on how to navigate Mastercard’s new rules for subscription billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundraise Up is aware of concerns about how Mastercard’s new subscription billing rules impact the nonprofit industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraise Up is working directly with Mastercard to address how nonprofits should interpret and follow the rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraise Up’s platform already meets all of the rules applicable to nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraise Up is offering expedited onboarding to nonprofits needing to increase their compliance with the new rules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;about-mastercards-new-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Mastercard’s new rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, known officially as “Transaction Processing Rules,” are designed to provide consumers with additional clarity and transparency about subscription billing terms and to reduce billing errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules apply to merchants &amp;#34;performing subscription billing in which the Cardholder has agreed for the Merchant to provide ongoing and/or periodic delivery of physical products or Digital Goods.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not explicitly stated in the processing rules document, Mastercard has confirmed that recurring donations are classified as subscriptions and fall within the scope of the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;explanation-of-the-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation of the rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four mandates that nonprofits must specifically follow under Mastercard’s new rules. They are listed below with responses from Fundraise Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The full terms of any subscription, such as the total cost and frequency of charges, must be disclosed to the consumer at the time their payment information is being collected.&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;✅&quot; class=&quot;callout green_background&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule met
&lt;/strong&gt;In Checkout, Donor Portal, and emails, a recurring plan’s total billable amount and billing schedule are clearly displayed. When Virtual Terminal is used, a customer may reference on-screen instructions for verbally disclosing subscription terms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merchants must provide an online cancellation method or clear instructions for cancellation that are easily accessible on the merchant&amp;#39;s website.&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;✅&quot; class=&quot;callout green_background&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule met
&lt;/strong&gt;Through Donor Portal, donors can easily cancel their recurring donation plans.

&lt;i&gt;To most easily comply with this rule, Fundraise Up recommends enabling the option to cancel recurring donations in Donor Portal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merchants must send a receipt after each billing that includes clear instructions on how to cancel, unless the customer opts out.&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;✅&quot; class=&quot;callout green_background&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule met
&lt;/strong&gt;For every recurring donation made using Fundraise Up, an email receipt is issued that includes a link for managing — and in this case, canceling — the recurring plan in Donor Portal.

&lt;i&gt;The Installment receipt email must be enabled to comply with this rule.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For recurring billings six months or more apart, merchants must notify the customer of the upcoming charge and provide cancellation information between seven and 30 days before the billing.&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;✅&quot; class=&quot;callout green_background&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule met
&lt;/strong&gt;Fundraise Up is launching a new email notification by September 22, 2022 to meet this requirement. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;when-the-rules-take-effect&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the rules take effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;Mastercard’s new rules take effect September 22, 2022. At this time, merchants are expected to take good faith measures to ensure that the rules are followed.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The rules are effective as of September 22, 2022 for nonprofits that experience a high number of chargebacks and are enrolled in one of Mastercard’s chargeback prevention programs. For more information, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/709b5382014b49dcb795a557578870dd&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;read this article&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Fundraise Up customer, you do not need to take any action at this time. The Fundraise Up platform already meets all of the rules applicable to nonprofits, and Fundraise Up is continuing to work with Mastercard on your behalf to develop additional guidance on how to follow the new subscription billing rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e071ea09-b1f0-47c5-b218-1fe5c32962fd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits not using Fundraise Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up recommends consulting directly with your platform vendor to determine the current scope of your compliance with the new rules. If your organization is out of compliance with multiple rules, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/contact-sales/&quot;&gt;contacting our sales team&lt;/a&gt;, which can expedite onboarding to Fundraise Up before the September 22 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/5fd5ab6834d1419abb7ed1de20c99635&quot;&gt;Since localization debuted earlier this year,&lt;/a&gt; Fundraise Up has been working hard to expand the number of languages offered for global fundraising, giving nonprofits more resources to reach donors wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now excited to announce language localizations for Italian, Swedish, and both European and Brazilian Portuguese. These languages join Spanish, French, Norwegian, and seven others supported by Fundraise Up, and we will continue to release more throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;translated-by-humans&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated by humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up’s language localizations aren’t machine translated. We partner with native speakers to produce accurate translations for specific countries and regional dialects. With our human-centric approach to language localization, your donor experience is tailored to your supporters no matter where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;customizable-translations&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customizable translations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, you get localized content throughout the entire donation experience — from Checkout and Donor Portal to email templates and donation receipts. On top of that, nonprofits can add their own translations for buttons, donation asks in Checkout, and acknowledgement emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;local-date-time-and-currency-formats&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local date, time, and currency formats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many countries have specific date, time, and currency formats. Fundraise Up’s localization features take this into account and automatically display the correct formats to donors. Plus, when you export data from Fundraise Up or sync it to your CRM, you can format the data to meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;support-for-any-website-structure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for any website structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you serve languages to online visitors, our localization tools let you match language settings to your donor’s browser preferences or your website’s URL configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;country-specific-features&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country-specific features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our growing selection of languages and dialects, we support features like Gift Aid, Direct Debit, specific address formats, and local compliances to provide a streamlined experience for you and your donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When charitable organizations come to work with us at Frontier, they generally want two things: to raise more money and to acquire more donors. Both are great goals for a charity. And when I founded Frontier in 2010, it was to help charities accomplish these two things both efficiently and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I dig deeper to see which goal they want to tackle first, they enthusiastically say, “Both!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh oh,” I say in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we encounter a common misconception about revenue and donor growth. Because while it would be great to grow your donor base &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;see immediate revenue gains, they aren’t compatible in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back — if your goal is increased fundraising revenue, you’ve got an important and stressful road ahead. But let me assure you: Revenue growth is achievable. My hope in writing this article for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/?utm_medium=email&quot;&gt;Fundraise Up&lt;/a&gt; is to give you the knowledge and tools to reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, there’s more than one marketing strategy to increase fundraising revenue. To list just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase current donor giving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve donor retention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire new donors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a good annual giving fundraising plan pursues all three, the strategy that receives the least attention is donor acquisition. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, donor acquisition requires trying something new. For most, this is difficult. This is particularly true in the charitable sector where organizations aren’t rewarded properly for risk. Going from zero to one is much harder than going from one to two. It’s going from nothing to something, and this is the greatest leap possible (&lt;a href=&quot;https://howdo.com/book-summaries/zero-to-one-summary-and-review/&quot;&gt;see Peter Tiel’s book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, acquisition is a financial investment without the guarantee of a strong ROI — a daunting and anxiety-inducing prospect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontier.io/&quot;&gt;Frontier Marketing&lt;/a&gt;, the agency I founded and where I lead strategy, acquisition almost always requires spending more money than you’ll initially earn, which brings me to an important metric: acquisition ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisition ROI — the amount of revenue &lt;i&gt;immediately received&lt;/i&gt; from new donors compared to the cost of the campaign — has averaged 80% for us at Frontier Marketing. If a client spent $1,000 on acquisition, it’s been our experience that new donors from the campaign would contribute around $800, leaving the organization out of pocket around $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the investment, acquisition is vital to organizational growth and success. Having raised nearly $100 million to date, our internal research suggests nonprofits with a healthy annual giving program only renew 60% to 75% of their donors each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means a healthy organization loses 25% to 40% of its donor base every year. Larger organizations build lapsed giving programs to welcome back their long-lost donors, and healthy ones see 10% to 15% of their donor base return each year, but not the little ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to give donor acquisition a try, here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember why people give&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define your value proposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know and expand your mediums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-remember-why-people-give&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Remember why people give&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5e1f1c09-8e9e-4cbc-a171-7993e03b7a2e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good marketers know about Maslow&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html&quot;&gt;hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;. While most gifts support the first two levels of Maslow’s hierarchy, for others, the &lt;i&gt;experience of giving&lt;/i&gt; allows the donor to move toward love and belonging, esteem, and, finally, self-actualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Frans, VP of Philanthropy at IFCC describes the healing journey possible for donors through philanthropy on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontier.io/podcast/episode-49&quot;&gt;Frontier FM podcast&lt;/a&gt;. When donors give to your organization, they are becoming the person they aspire to be. Good fundraising affirms the donor’s identity as the best version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterfundraising.com/people-make-donations-to-tell-ourselves/&quot;&gt;Better Fundraising Co&lt;/a&gt;, Stephen Screen expands on this concept further by saying that when we give, it helps us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Become who we want to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to be who we want to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remake the world in the way we think it should be&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this as you sit down to plan your acquisition fundraising. You want growth that helps your charity tackle important issues. Your donor does, too. But ultimately, it’s because their act of support reflects the kind of person they aspire to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=c0337aee-771b-4b8f-9a29-38484ac0de85&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Define your value proposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek &lt;/a&gt;happy and started with why. Now you’re going to ask for the gift. At the end of the day, you need to tell a readable and dynamic story. If you’re writing an appeal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyoptimizer.net/&quot;&gt;copyoptimizer.net&lt;/a&gt; can help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s fundraising doesn’t need any of the tropes of the past that involve demeaning the people who you ultimately hope to help. Exciting positive language often wins out over tragic or unpleasant portrayals of the challenges your organization is trying to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we worked with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vplf.ca/&quot;&gt;Vancouver Public Library Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (VPLF) to achieve stellar acquisition results with the story of a mother, Lisa, learning to sing nursery rhymes, thanks to access to library programming.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t just ask for support for people like Lisa. We ensured there was a specific price and an easily solvable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ask” is your brand promise to them. Your partnership through that delivers tangible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be simple, clear, and definitive. And remember, it’s about your cause, not your charity. They’ve never given to you before, so we know they’re not “fans” of your charity. But they may feel compelled to be part of an easily solvable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another way to look at the ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“$X provides this verb for this noun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our experience, initial gifts to a charity are around $80, so consider offering a range of asks around this amount. For example, with VPLF, we gave different options ranging from $35 to $150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more about how to create and improve your value proposition, I recommend checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextafter.com/blog/nonprofit-value-proposition-4-proven-ways-to-help-donors-understand-why-they-should-give/&quot;&gt;NextAfter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=357d371c-8489-4941-9d36-16332b86c18b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Know and expand your mediums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know why folks give, and you’ve laid out your offer to donors. Finally, we’re talking about how. In our experience, most new donor acquisition occurs through the mail, but that’s not where it should end. Let’s explore a few other ways to grow your donor pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting events, peer-to-peer fundraising, raffles, and other “near giving” experiences are all lead generation tactics. Clear communication with your leads is key when you ask them to become donors to your cause through a direct gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital advertising should focus on lead generation. In other words, ask for an email address, not a gift. But if you must, build a compelling ad, usually on Facebook; design a landing page that reinforces the message; and lead to a donation experience that’s extraordinarily easy to navigate, like Fundraise Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In digital, we advertise what’s known as “lead magnets” where something of value — a resource or a webinar — can only be accessed by giving contact information. Another successful method in this regard is through a pledge or petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your landing page should reinforce the donor&amp;#39;s decision to give, demonstrate the anticipated impact of their support, and show how their donation puts their values into action. Supporting copy is great if it’s &lt;i&gt;reminding,&lt;/i&gt; not&lt;i&gt; selling&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In print, you must contend with postage costs and print setup costs. If your budget is tight, you’ll likely struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returnable inserts in newspapers are a common method for cheap production but yield response rates are low, ranging from 0.05% to 0.3%. Some of our clients have seen success by asking readers to answer a few survey questions that lead them to a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending unaddressed mail and targeting postal walks — or neighborhoods — is a good investment for a charity serving the area. In my Canadian context, Canada post offers deep discounts on postage for unaddressed mail. Our response rates range from 0.15% to 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, rental lists do something magical to the problem of communicating with non-donors — while they don’t know you, you know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rent a mailing list, you pay the regular postage rate plus a fee to borrow the contact information of the would-be donor. A higher initial investment but with the huge advantage of addressing the recipient personally. The results speak for themselves, with our clients seeing rates between 1.5% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from nothing to something is a brave and important endeavor. And diving into donor acquisition requires nothing less than a courageous commitment to try something new. Charities will always need to grow revenue and donor acquisition is essential to maximizing success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educating charity leaders on donor acquisition and its long-term revenue-generating potential is essential to helping organizations lean into new opportunities for growth. My hope for this article is it may lead organizations to advocate for acquisition and prioritize adding this strategy to their marketing mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;ℹ️&quot; class=&quot;callout blue_background&quot;&gt;On October 11, 2022, Mastercard updated its Transaction Processing Rules to exempt nonprofits. For the most accurate information about how Mastercard’s subscription billing rules effect nonprofits, read: &lt;a href=&quot;/0705fa1731564ee3bd11b5e95a8e9165&quot;&gt;Mastercard Sets Rules Exemption for Nonprofits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastercard has updated its guidance for nonprofits regarding the new subscription billing rules. Read about the two key updates below, and if you haven&amp;#39;t already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/mastercard-rules&quot;&gt;register for our September 7 live session with Mastercard,&lt;/a&gt; where we&amp;#39;re partnering to explain the rules in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;deadline-extension&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;s&gt;Deadline extension&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;Mastercard has extended the implementation deadline for the rules. For nonprofits, specifically, the new effective date for the rules is March 21, 2023. As a reminder, Mastercard&amp;#39;s new rules apply to subscription-style billing. For our industry, this includes recurring giving. Therefore, the rules are applicable to nonprofits.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The rules are effective as of September 22, 2022 for nonprofits that experience a high number of chargebacks and are enrolled in one of Mastercard’s chargeback prevention programs. For more information, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/709b5382014b49dcb795a557578870dd&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;read this article&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;monthly-notification-requirement&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly notification requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastercard&amp;#39;s new rules state that a receipt, sent by email, must be delivered to card holders after every billing. Mastercard has clarified that if an email address for a recurring donor is not collected, a nonprofit does not need to provide notification by other means such as postal mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;our-take&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our take&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline extension provides nonprofits with more time to to develop paths toward compliance with the new rules. However, we recommend pursuing compliance now. This approach enables your organization to implement and test any new processes well in advance of the new March deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the clarification about monthly notification requirements benefits organizations that do not yet have systems in place to facilitate electronic receipting by email. Our recommendation for these nonprofits is to work toward meeting the rule&amp;#39;s requirements anyway. Our research has shown that aligning with consumer expectations improves donor experience and increases giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Mastercard&amp;#39;s new rules and to get further guidance on how to follow them, make sure you&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/mastercard-rules&quot;&gt;registered for the September 7 live session&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/mastercard-rules&quot;&gt;invite others in the industry to join.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

GA4 uses an event-based data model, offers more privacy]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/everything-nonprofits-need-to-know-about-GA4</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/everything-nonprofits-need-to-know-about-GA4</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/8f3e6a56-fbf5-4b41-86b0-ee9cd2ad6e49/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is sunsetting Universal Analytics on July 1, 2023, which means it’s the time to learn about what will take its place: Google Analytics 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 uses an event-based data model, offers more privacy protection, doesn&amp;#39;t rely exclusively on cookies, and can operate across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;whats-new-with-ga4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new with GA4?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 has many changes, but let’s dive deeper into the three most important updates that all organizations should know about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Event-based conversions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI and machine learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features need time to work effectively and efficiently. To take full advantage of GA4&amp;#39;s measurement continuity, automated insights about the customer journey, and easy activation to improve marketing ROI, organizations should start their GA4 transition as soon as possible and simultaneously run both Analytics versions to obtain the best results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=0927f85a-c56d-4279-b3c1-3ba28d1cd3b9&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Events-based tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 has remodeled the tracking systems to no longer focus on sessions. With its event-based model, GA4 now treats each user interaction as a separate event to give you information about what&amp;#39;s occurring on your website or app, such as first visits, page views, button clicks, user actions, or system events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events can gather and communicate data that further explains the user&amp;#39;s action and provides additional context. This data may include specifics like the donation amount, the URL of the page the user visited, or their precise location. An event allows you to measure distinct user interaction on a website or app and learn more about your supporters than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=39f4c489-b49d-4b2c-8fce-8154d8581bdc&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, explorations and reports display your data differently. Explorations query raw event and user-level data while reports rely on daily aggregated tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#34;Explore&amp;#34; area offers advanced techniques that go beyond standard reports to help you uncover deeper insights into your supporters&amp;#39; behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview reports are a dashboard containing a set of cards that summarizes the detailed reports on a chosen topic. A topic can have only one overview report, such as &amp;#34;What are your user demographics?&amp;#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Realtime report allows you to keep an eye on the activity as it happens (5 seconds to 30 minutes prior). Based on the most accurate user identifiers available, Analytics can track a single user&amp;#39;s trip across many devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enhanced measurement feature automatically collects additional events without requiring you to modify the code of your website. You can measure a variety of typical web events, including page views, scrolls, file downloads, and video views.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users will also be able to edit the Analytics interface to better fit their needs. Allowing users to customize what their reports look like — not just for custom reports but for the default reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and reports can be tricky, especially when learning the ins and outs of a new Analytics platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure3.convio.net/hjcnm/site/SPageServer?pagename=GA4_Webpage.html&quot;&gt;hjc’s team of Google Analytics professionals is ready to make reporting easy for you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=d921c734-e907-4ba9-bf7f-7ed290e8596a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics intelligence: How does this work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both reports and explorations in GA4 leverage machine learning to make your data more meaningful, accessible, and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that Google Analytics will track users who come to your website and agree to be tracked. Now, GA4 will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning so that when cookies are blocked, GA4 will backfill the missing data based on prior learnings — this is called behavioral consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the best results, artificial intelligence and machine learning need time to begin learning and should be set up as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;ga4-in-a-cookieless-world&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GA4 in a cookieless world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 no longer uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/death-of-tracking-cookies&quot;&gt;third-party cookies,&lt;/a&gt; which are set up by domain(s) other than the one being visited. GA4 now leverages first-party cookies, which are directly set up by the website domain, to improve the user experience — like remembering your password, keeping your cart contents active, or sharing a reminder to complete your donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is also designed for a future with or without cookies or other identifiers. In the future, GA4 will utilize machine learning to fill in data gaps. For instance, there could be cookies missing when measuring conversions across devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, you won&amp;#39;t be able to link some of your conversions to the appropriate users who engaged with an ad. This will leave gaps in the customer journey if modeling techniques are not used. With a modeling foundation, observable data can feed algorithms that also use previous trends to validate and inform measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ce6154df-2020-496f-a207-6e1efbc855e3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is data collected and stored?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=3ea6d4cc-9d51-47d1-816e-7c993e467627&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event-based model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an event-based model means each user interaction is processed as a standalone event, allowing you to measure specific user interactions on your website or app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First click: What brought them to the website?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last click: What was the final interaction on the website?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-driven: Did they come in through the web app, did they donate, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=64eab367-3806-4039-a93c-dc437452fff6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymizing IP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all users&amp;#39; IP addresses are anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e1619c79-7677-4a99-9f17-750e44daa40f&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 doesn’t give you the option to control where data is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1fd5c708-0129-4cb6-a7d6-ab40eff6a9bd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 offers Consent Mode, which ensures your tracking responds accurately to users’ opt-in/out decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e41d272b-38f3-42f9-b5a9-291c238e4b89&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 simplifies data retention to either timeframe: two months or 14 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=8c53bb5b-68ba-4638-90d1-0ac06d0d8fd4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing between Google products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google allows you to share GA4 data with other tools in the Google ecosystem, specifically Google Signals and Ad Personalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=cd325bea-fb6e-4e6e-9169-002f057d3741&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does GA4 adhere to new data privacy laws and regulations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 relies on first-party cookies, which keeps it compliant with new privacy laws like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Analytics offers settings to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Block the acquisition of data from Google Signals on a per-regional basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block the per-regional collection of precise location and device data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=001de86e-e48b-47d8-981f-75bad7337851&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User data deletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 allows you to segment your users and delete individual user data if needed. This is an important feature as granting users the right to request their data be deleted adheres to most privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=9721fcc6-9184-441c-9ea9-6fdd7ce84988&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personally Identifiable Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 doesn’t allow the capture of PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
 and if identified, the data will be flagged for deletion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=bd9adda0-fe50-4518-9180-2b8dbfea17ff&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie banner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA4 requires you to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://cookie-script.com/blog/google-analytics-4-and-gdpr#:~:text=However%2C%20if%20you%20do,this%20information%20into%20it&quot;&gt;a cookie consent banner&lt;/a&gt; only in cases where the account has disabled IP anonymization (which is enabled by default) and if the account has connected its GA4 account to Google Ads or Signals and opted to share GA data with these apps. Even then, GA4 doesn’t facilitate the actual cookie banner itself. This must be done by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-switch-when-is-it-happening--what-do-nonprofits-need-to-do&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The switch: When is it happening &amp;amp; what do nonprofits need to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking and now is the time to start discussing your switch to GA4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the best out of GA4, you must allow your organization a transition period where Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4 can be executed simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;ℹ️&quot; class=&quot;callout blue_background&quot;&gt;On October 11, 2022, Mastercard updated its Transaction Processing Rules to exempt nonprofits. For the most accurate information about how Mastercard’s subscription billing rules effect nonprofits, read: &lt;a href=&quot;/0705fa1731564ee3bd11b5e95a8e9165&quot;&gt;Mastercard Sets Rules Exemption for Nonprofits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 20 questions asked during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/mastercard-rules&quot;&gt;September 7 live session&lt;/a&gt; we hosted with Mastercard to go over their new rules for subscription billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the questions have been edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When reading the Transaction Processing Rules, the list of transaction types includes goods and services — not donations. Were recurring donations considered when these rules were written? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Though not specifically defined in Mastercard’s rules document, Mastercard has confirmed that recurring donations qualify as subscriptions and are therefore within the scope of the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are charitable donations not treated as a recurring payment instead of a subscription?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurring payments and subscriptions are the same thing. Someone makes recurring payments (donations) as part of a subscription billing agreement (recurring plan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage of chargebacks are attributed to nonprofits and their recurring donations as opposed to for-profit subscriptions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nonprofit Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnpa.org/mastercard/&quot;&gt;researched this&lt;/a&gt; and reported that nonprofits have lower chargeback rates than for-profit counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are nonprofits just now hearing about these changes?
&lt;/strong&gt;It wasn’t clear until a few weeks ago that Mastercard’s new rules affected nonprofits. When we learned that the scope of the rules included nonprofits, we partnered with Mastercard to  &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/mastercard-rules/&quot;&gt;provide immediate guidance&lt;/a&gt; to organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this apply to existing recurring billing or new signups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;New signups when the rules take effect on &lt;s&gt;March 21, 2023&lt;/s&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I heard Visa is exempting charities from its changes. If so, why wouldn&amp;#39;t Mastercard do the same?
&lt;/strong&gt;Visa’s rules don’t exempt nonprofits — they do not apply to nonprofits. Mastercard’s rules do apply to nonprofits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the penalties for not complying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastercard hasn’t issued specific guidance for this, but all organization should pursue compliance by the &lt;s&gt;March 21, 2023&lt;/s&gt; deadline to avoid issues with noncompliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you believe you are compliant but find out you are not, what happens? Will Mastercard allow you to become compliant, or will you never be able to process Mastercard donations again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastercard hasn’t outlined specific penalties for noncompliance, but nonprofits should make good-faith efforts to comply with the rules before they take effect on &lt;s&gt;March 21, 2023&lt;/s&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we do not have an email address for a donor, are we required to reach out after each gift in another way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Mastercard says additional efforts to notify the donor are not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if we have a donor’s email address, but they have opted out of receiving emails from us?
&lt;/strong&gt;You don’t need to send notifications to the donor,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but make sure you’re compliant anyway. This enables you to follow the rules even when donors change their communication preferences in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we have a donor that signs up as a monthly donor offline and provides an email address, do we still need to send them an email notification?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Because the donor provided their email address to you, you should send the billing notifications that Mastercard’s rules require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For sending confirmation of enrollment, successful billing, or cancellation methods, how do we comply with these requirements for donors who don&amp;#39;t provide their email address or use our website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to send billing notifications to donors who don’t provide an email address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we still have to notify telemarketing donors through email even though they didn’t provide their email through our website?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should collect a donor’s email address during a telemarketing phone call. However, if the donor does not provide an email address, you don’t need to send them the billing notifications mandated by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is providing donors with an email and phone number to cancel sufficient? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but to comply with Mastercard’s rules, the email address or phone number needs to be in an easy-to-find location on your nonprofit’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; In some cases, we haven&amp;#39;t retained if a card is Mastercard, Visa, etc. What is our obligation to retrieve that data to meet these requirements, or are we obligated to comply only when we can confirm a card is a Mastercard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to gather card details for recurring plans created before the new rules take effect on &lt;s&gt;March 21, 2023&lt;/s&gt;. But by this date, you should have the mechanisms in place to identify card type in order to provide the required billing notices to donors who give using a Mastercard payment method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon does a monthly receipt need to be sent following each monthly donation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastercard doesn’t outline a specific notification window, but to align with consumer expectations, send a receipt when the donation is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you confirm that we can use the wording “Manage my donation” vs. “Cancel”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Mastercard says you can implement either term to satisfy the requirement for providing an online cancellation method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Fundraise Up give us the ability to create unique emails based on billing method?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Fundraise Up automatically sends required billing notifications to donors who give using a Mastercard payment method. Other payment methods, such as Visa, American Express, and Discover, are exempted from these notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Fundraise Up assist us in complying with the pre-notification requirement involving billings that occur over six months or longer increments of time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Fundraise Up is fully compliant with all of Mastercard’s new rules. If you are a Fundraise Up customer, no action is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can nonprofits go for up-to-date information about Mastercard&amp;#39;s changes? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up. As a Mastercard Preferred Partner, we’re able to provide timely and accurate updates about Mastercard’s new rules and how they impact nonprofits.

&lt;p&gt;In a first for the nonprofit industry, Fundraise Up has become a certified guarantor of the STAMP &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medallionsignatureguarantee.asp&quot;&gt;Medallion Signature Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;, a program that authorizes the transfer of stocks, mutual funds, and other securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certification allows Fundraise Up to process stock donations of up to $1M per transaction for nonprofits that use our donation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special guarantee, which is typically difficult and costly to obtain for individuals transferring securities, is offered by Fundraise Up at no cost to donors or nonprofits using our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting certified was the final puzzle we needed to solve,” says Peter Byrnes, who is CEO of Fundraise Up. “We developed a seamless way for nonprofits to accept stock gifts through their websites, but without the signature guarantee, there would be a massively negative impact on conversion and donor experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a Medallion Signature Guarantee may not be required for all stock donations, brokerage firms such as Fidelity Investments require the imprint on transfer of a certain size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up’s signature certification arrives as we &lt;a href=&quot;/3d63db1ed2844bc39718d6bb6ef5f91e&quot;&gt;launch stock giving&lt;/a&gt; as a donation option in our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/stock-giving/&quot;&gt;stock giving feature&lt;/a&gt; is designed to replace an otherwise offline and complex donation process with a simplified online experience that automates the transfer of stocks from donors to nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Fundraise Up to accept stock donations. With this high-value way to give, your organization can now easily and securely accept stock donations directly through your website. Stock giving joins cards, wallets, bank transfers, and crypto as an available &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/payment-methods/&quot;&gt;payment methods&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout Modal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/campaign-pages&quot;&gt;Campaign Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;add-stock-giving-to-your-online-donor-experience&quot;&gt;Add stock giving to your online donor experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, giving stock has been a cumbersome and offline process, and the responsibility has always been on the donor to navigate complicated donation instructions provided by nonprofit organizations and brokerage firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up’s launch of stock giving takes the entire process online, removes the burden from donors, and provides nonprofits with a single platform to handle virtually any type of online giving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=03b0740d-c01c-48af-8c44-bbd848dc5c77&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you accept stock donations, we developed a flow in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/campaign-pages&quot;&gt;Campaign Pages&lt;/a&gt; that handles everything from brokerage account login using Plaid, to stock selection and signature capture. The stock giving flow is seamlessly integrated into the existing donation checkout experience, making it easy for donors to dynamically switch between standard currency and stock donation modes, or initiate donations from dedicated stock donation checkouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=4ff167e9-a806-49af-b8bd-09d4d5fa91b9&gt;Making a donation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a05c31f3-00b6-415f-b0f8-1f32f166a820/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, donating stock is as easy as making a credit card donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a donor has entered a stock donation checkout, they are prompted to log-in to their brokerage account. This can be done automatically using our integration with Plaid, or manually by providing brokerage account details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we’ve seen with Instant ACH bank transfer donations, we expect that a majority of stock donors will take advantage of logging into their brokerage accounts with Plaid. This method displays the stocks held in a donor’s portfolio and validates the number of shares available to donate so that a donor doesn’t accidentally donate more shares than they’re able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both the Plaid and manual stock donation methods, Checkout provides the real-time dollar market price for shares, making it easy for donors to know the value of their stock donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a donor has selected shares to donate, they authorize the transfer using an e-signature, which completes the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a standard currency checkout, a stock donation checkout can be customized to toggle features like tribute giving, gift designations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/languages/&quot;&gt;language localizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e264fc80-96d5-4ba2-b1b9-22c387abfb73&gt;Transferring stocks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bc372db1-b164-47f4-bbcf-9591687eb350/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move away from paper forms and the complex steps. Fundraise Up automates the entire stock donation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a donor has completed their stock donation using &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;, Fundraise Up begins the transfer process. This involves creating a transfer request with the donor’s brokerage firm and tracking the progress of the transfer until it is complete. If any issues pop up along the way, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/enterprise-support/&quot;&gt;have a team&lt;/a&gt; that handles them on behalf of the donor and recipient nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=c6225222-ac86-4089-8433-7403861ca9a5&gt;Completing the donation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/629f2fe2-f807-4c0d-890b-86b1b5f0a8d1/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplify the donor experience by using one platform to accept any type of donation through your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we confirm that a donor’s stock has been transferred from their brokerage account to the nonprofit’s account, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/emails/&quot;&gt;donation receipt email&lt;/a&gt; is sent, which includes a PDF receipt for the donor’s tax records. Since stock is classified as property by the U.S. government, we send an in-kind donation receipt that displays the total number of stocks and shares donated and not the approximate dollar value of the shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nonprofit’s Fundraise Up dashboard, they have access to all of the details about the donor’s stock donation and can automatically sync the donation to a connected CRM like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, or Blackbaud CRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=c83e2e02-d7ac-42f7-b87c-ff473853863b&gt;Donor Portal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/edace440-a2b2-4f3c-a2e7-ee26b94f3ec7/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/donor-portal/&quot;&gt;Donor Portal&lt;/a&gt;, donors can view and manage their stock donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like other donations made using Fundraise Up, stock gifts are displayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/donor-portal/&quot;&gt;Donor Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a self-service dashboard that lets donors manage their online giving. With stock donations, Donor Portal is a great way to track the status of an in-progress transfer, and after the transfer has been completed, Donor Portal offers access to the transaction’s details, the donation receipt, and other helpful donor tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=151cd357-5d02-497b-a184-5edc57e7dada&gt;Liquidating donated stocks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take a bring-your-own-account approach to stock giving. This means that instead of Fundraise Up controlling and liquidating your stock donations through a brokerage account that we own, you connect your nonprofit’s brokerage account to our platform to directly receive stock donations from donors. This gives you the opportunity to either hold onto the stocks (useful if you use stock giving as an investment strategy), or liquidate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liquidate stocks by selling them through your brokerage, you can then transfer the funds to your nonprofit’s bank account and apply them toward the programs and services that you offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;unlock-donations-worth-70x-more-than-cash-gifts&quot;&gt;Unlock donations worth 70x more than cash gifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/9ad15880-996e-4e88-ab80-73a985c266bc/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 58% of Americans own stocks, and those stocks carry a $48M market valuation. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey we conducted found that a majority of stock donations recorded by nonprofits exceeded $5,000 in value, and 28% of respondents reported receiving stock donations worth more than $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding stock as an online donation method is not only a way to engage high-value donors directly on your website, it’s a proven catalyst for growing your nonprofit. A study that &lt;a href=&quot;https://openrice.rice.edu/session/why-cash-is-not-king-in-fundraising&quot;&gt;analyzed donations to nonprofits over a five year period&lt;/a&gt; found that organizations that accepted gifts of securities like stock experienced a 66% growth factor. The proof is in the punch that stock donations pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 58% of Americans own stocks, and those stocks carry a $48M market valuation. These stocks are typically held by older, well-educated individuals whose household income exceeds $100,000. But stock ownership spans the generations, and you’ll find potential donors in Millennial and even Gen-Z segments of your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from all generations, you can anticipate a propensity to give using stocks. Philanthropy powered by non-cash assets has grown over the years. In fact, a 2020 report by Fidelity Charitable found that more than 68% of contributions made to member giving funds had been fueled by cash alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medallionsignatureguarantee.asp&quot;&gt;Medallion Signature Guarantee&lt;/a&gt; is a program that is used to authorize high-value stock transfers. For stock donations — typically those that are valued at $15,000 or more — the Medallion Signature Guarantee is often a requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a Medallion Signature Guarantee can be a complicated and sometimes costly task. It requires extra, in-person steps for donors that add significant friction to the donor experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove this friction, Fundraise Up has &lt;a href=&quot;/a1a3a0d12f754144891a8aaa3b8d2a31&quot;&gt;become a certified member&lt;/a&gt; of the Medallion Signature Guarantee program. This means that we can authorize and seamlessly process stock donations of up to $1M in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certification is an industry-first for technology companies serving the nonprofit space, and even across other industries, Fundraise Up is one of only two companies known to provide online Medallion Signature Guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say hello to Popup, the latest Element to join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements&quot;&gt;library of fundraising UI components&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Popup to display attention-grabbing calls to action on your nonprofit’s website that prompt visitors to donate. Popup launches in the center of a visitor’s screen, dims the content behind it, and puts the emphasis on the opportunity to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup also includes AI-driven features that optimize how and when it’s shown to your site visitors. This way, more people who see it go on to donate, and search engines don’t mark your popups as an intrusive interstitial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other Elements, Popup is customizable. Add an image, set a title and description, write a label for the CTA button, and choose when you want Popup to display. Popup looks great on desktop browsers and it’s optimized for mobile, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup is the perfect addition to your digital marketing mix. You can create several variations to segment campaigns, and use Popup’s URL control feature to determine which pages each popup should trigger on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup will also make your web developers and finance teams very happy. There’s no extra code to install on your website and no extra costs to use it — just greater engagement and more people giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re really excited to see how you fundraise with Popup. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givingtuesday.org/&quot;&gt;GivingTuesday&lt;/a&gt; and year-end fundraising right around the corner, now is a great time to integrate Popup into your online fundraising plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent any time browsing an online store, you’ve likely encountered a popup. No, not the irritating kind that your ad blocker keeps at bay. I’m talking about the kind of popups that online retailers show you to promote their products and lure you in with discounts. 20% off? Count me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These popups can be incredibly effective at getting us to make purchases. The best-performing ones even net a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/60-exit-intent-pop-up-examples-that-convert-plus-bonus-tactics/&quot;&gt;60% conversion rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do popups have a place in nonprofit fundraising? They certainly do, and in the same way that popups can be used to increase e-commerce sales, they can be used to increase online giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we created Popup, an engaging overlay-style &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; that you can add to your website without writing a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the features available with Popup and some best practices you can take to maximize its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/de0043bb-2487-4afc-94ef-0d98c80ffb52/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding an image to a popup isn’t just a nice touch — it’s a big conversion booster. In fact, popups that include images &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drip.com/blog/popup-statistics&quot;&gt;convert up to 83% better&lt;/a&gt; than text-only popups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the greater your conversion off of Popup, the more donors you’re engaging with giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to pick the best image for Popup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a photo with people in it. Do this even if your nonprofit’s work is with animals, nature, or other non-human causes. Website visitors respond best to photos that feature people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show faces. Donors respond best to faces, not people’s silhouettes or backsides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show expressive faces. Expressive faces engage donors. Don’t believe it? Check out Netflix’s fascinating article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-power-of-a-picture&quot;&gt;images that increase engagement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;heading-and-description&quot;&gt;Heading and description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5ae5f8ce-c12f-420f-b503-2a973ac9d184/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup gives you space to add a compelling heading and a description to support it. Use the headline to hook visitors and the description to draw them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best headlines are clear and concise: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cxl.com/blog/5-characteristics-high-converting-headlines/&quot;&gt;5-9 words&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://cxl.com/blog/5-characteristics-high-converting-headlines/&quot;&gt;include numbers&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps counterintuitively, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cxl.com/blog/5-characteristics-high-converting-headlines/&quot;&gt;highlight something negative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad: &lt;/strong&gt;Change the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better: &lt;/strong&gt;150 people are without homes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in crafting your descriptions, remember that donors will react best to language that places them at the center of the story — don’t talk about yourself. Instead, tell the donor how they can be a part of solving a problem and use specific language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad: &lt;/strong&gt;Donate to our organization so that we can help people in need. We have many certifications and have been helping people for years. Any amount helps! Donate now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better: &lt;/strong&gt;Save the life of a child suffering from malaria. With just $10, you can cover the cost of a vaccine and medical care. Donate now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/95e2a2ef-c14e-4178-a95e-7af8184d86ec/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of each popup is a button that launches &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;, but to get a visitor to click it the first place, you have to have the right call to action in place. The key word is “action.” And your button should invite a website visitor to do just that: take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of effective CTA button labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate $10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate a vaccine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these examples will help you secure conversions, but where possible, you should A/B test the language you use to hone-in on the most optimal button label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you should select a color for your button. And though it may seem counterintuitive, the color you select doesn’t have to match your brand’s color scheme. Our research on color effectiveness has shown no discernable improvement in conversion when brand-specific colors are used for buttons and other UI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you should select a button color that suggests urgency, aligns with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/&quot;&gt;WCAG standards for accessibility&lt;/a&gt;, and is culturally appropriate within the market where you’re fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break these things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=6daccc34-d35f-459d-9532-139f5031434b&gt;Colors that suggest urgency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red, yellow, and orange, are three colors that suggest urgency. They are best used for time-sensitive campaigns like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givingtuesday.org/&quot;&gt;GivingTuesday&lt;/a&gt; and year-end fundraising, or for crisis campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, colors have varying meanings amongst the world’s cultures. I cover this in a later section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=758c56f1-88f7-43b3-9838-5874610d6262&gt;WCAG standards for color contrast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/67854f67-9a7a-456c-a91e-dbbfc1f4fab1/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WCAG standards dictate that a button and its label &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html&quot;&gt;maintain a certain contrast ratio&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, there must be a 3:1 difference in contrast between the color used for the background of the button and its label text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following WCAG standards is important for creating an accessible giving experience, so you should choose a color that conforms to these accessibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your organization’s color palette may not have been chosen with accessibility in mind, so it’s possible that a color in your palette won’t meet WCAG standards. You can test your button background and label color combinations using a free tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer&quot;&gt;this one from Adobe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=da2143ec-5203-4766-9b0b-6d85d6b9dfe7&gt;Colors and cultural significance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/8553aa49-e15f-431b-aee6-daedd8cb1b61/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re fundraising in multiple markets, understanding how different cultures interpret colors is important. For example, red may be an effective “urgency” color to use with Western cultures, but elsewhere in the world, the color red is associated with evil and may actually offend potential donors rather than engaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our localization partners at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eriksen.com/&quot;&gt;Eriksen Translations&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eriksen.com/marketing/color_culture/&quot;&gt;fantastic article&lt;/a&gt; on the connection between colors and cultures. Check it out and be sure to download their “colors across cultures” chart as a helpful reference to have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;visibility-settings&quot;&gt;Visibility settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/24ca42d9-84f5-4482-9933-108647f1844e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup’s visibility controls let you determine where and how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; will appear. This is defined by the type of device a donor uses, the URL the donor uses to visit your website, the display trigger settings you apply to each Popup, or a combination of the three settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the triggers you can use to display Popup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On page load: &lt;/strong&gt;Popup will display immediately when the webpage loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On timeout: &lt;/strong&gt;Popup will display a few seconds after the page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On scroll: &lt;/strong&gt;Popup will display when a certain percentage of the webpage has been scrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On inactivity: &lt;/strong&gt;Popup will display a few seconds after the last cursor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On exit: &lt;/strong&gt;Popup will display when the cursor has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/exit-intent-how-does-it-work/&quot;&gt;moved from the webpage to the browser toolbar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set up Popup, you’ll notice that you can’t modify triggers for scroll distance or time delays. This is because we automatically calculate the values that are most likely to convert using machine learning. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e02cb554-e444-4a08-b9c6-77f908e26f6f&gt;Show on desktop, mobile, or both&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f24c5494-5263-4a65-82de-60f0958fc7d9/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set up multiple instances of Popup and have a version that displays only on desktop devices like a laptops, and a version that only displays on mobile devices like phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you can create a popup that triggers on exit-intent for desktop visitors and another popup that uses a scroll-based trigger to display for mobile visitors. You get endless flexibility that helps you optimize the giving experience for any donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1025db20-55bb-490b-b57f-c64764582253&gt;URL controls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/0c991852-f974-4e22-9d17-805dd331e67a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup and all of our overlay-style Elements include settings for URL control. These settings let you determine where on your website Popup should appear. For example, you might want to show Popup on your home page but not on the landing page for a specific campaign. Popup’s URL controls make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For power users, URL control settings even give you the ability to target website visitors based on the URL parameters they visit your website with. This enables you to create channel and campaign-specific popups — perfect for use with ads, email marketing, and even direct mail when you use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/&quot;&gt;QR Code Element&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;custom-fields&quot;&gt;Custom fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d390814f-8646-4dfd-a1de-5ca822471de0/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other components in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/&quot;&gt;Elements library&lt;/a&gt;, Popup can pass through custom field data to the campaign its connected to. You can use custom fields to track properties like appeal codes or other data points that are specific to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, custom field data can even be populated using URL query strings, giving you tracking capabilities beyond standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/utm-codes/370088/&quot;&gt;UTM parameters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;localization&quot;&gt;Localization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up’s built-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/languages/&quot;&gt;localization tools&lt;/a&gt; unlock your ability to connect with donors in 20 languages (with support for more on the way!). This means that along with Checkout, Donor Portal, and other features, you can display Popup in a donor’s preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? In the U.S. alone, nearly 12% of donations made to nonprofits are completed using browsers set to a language other than American English. Similarly, up to 17% of online donation revenue for U.S.-based nonprofits is received from donors giving elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization not only increases the accessibility of your donation experience, it opens the door to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/global-fundraising/&quot;&gt;engaging donors on a global scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popup is simple but mighty &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;. Everything you see (and don’t see) is an intentional orchestration of conversion optimizations that engage donors and increase giving. And thanks to Popup’s incredible versatility, it looks great on any device and has all of the settings you need to show it to the right donors at the right times and on the right pages of your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits using Fundraise Up can now enable adaptive cost coverage, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to determine which donors should be prompted to cover the fees for their donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive cost coverage is designed to increase conversion, and early results show a jump in conversion rate and a notable increase in donation revenue when the feature is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research by Fundraise Up found that while a majority of donors are in favor of covering processing fees for a nonprofit — 92% of donors do when donating using Fundraise Up — there are some occurrences where the ask has a negative impact on conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With adaptive cost coverage enabled, nonprofits can look forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased online donation revenue (+1.5%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher conversion on larger donation sizes ($1,000+)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive cost coverage can be toggled on for any standard currency &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;. There is no additional cost to use the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

Some donors]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/adaptive-cost-coverage-science</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/adaptive-cost-coverage-science</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f5f77214-7995-4385-9038-87adacc6144d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you ask donors to cover the transaction fees for their donations? The question has stuck to the nonprofit industry like glue for decades. The answer is yes… but there’s also a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some donors are more likely to cover transaction costs than others. And in some cases, asking actually lowers your chance of securing certain donations. So what’s the right way to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is adaptive cost coverage, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/adaptive-cost-coverage&quot;&gt;feature we’ve introduced&lt;/a&gt; that uses artificial intelligence to determine which donors you should ask to cover transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to see why we integrated AI technology into adaptive cost coverage and the results the feature is delivering for nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;researching-fee-coverage-dynamics&quot;&gt;Researching fee coverage dynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first tackled the covering fees dilemma in the fall of 2021, we found that a majority — 92% of donors — would cover the fees associated with processing their donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that if a donor covered the fees on their first donation, there was a 26% chance that they’d do it again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for organizations that pre-checked the covering fees option for donors, there was a 12% increase in the number of donors who would cover fees on future donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43% of donors would even tick the box for covering fees if it wasn’t checked by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beneath the top-level stats was a layer of nuance that revealed personas that didn’t respond as positively to fee covering prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, donors who gave between $500 and $1,000 were 18% less likely to cover fees than donors giving downrange gifts of $60-$120. This behavior was present with both one-time and recurring donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparent solution would be to write some logic that hides the option to cover fees based on donation size, but the behavioral nuances extend beyond what simple conditional arguments can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;understanding-human-behavior&quot;&gt;Understanding human behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our decisions are influenced by our environment and by the world at large. Enough so that events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine &lt;a href=&quot;/751807936ed949f18f4062ee0b1c3b47&quot;&gt;alter the way we give&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between environment and behavior is important because it reveals that one-size-fits-all methodologies never really work, especially at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there’s one way that a one-size-fits-all approach could work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you replaced every person on the planet with clones of yourself and held a family reunion in California. You and your 7.6 billion copies could cram into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-human-cube-the-volume-of-humanity&quot;&gt;470 million cubic meter box&lt;/a&gt; and float around San Francisco Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be ideal because you and your billions-strong cohort all think the same way and are all in the same place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I can figure out just one of you, I have figured out all of you. And if one of you will cover the fees on a donation, all of you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since none of this is possible, it’s impossible to know in any moment the factors that are influencing people’s decisions. But we can make incredibly well-educated guesses with some help from machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;optimizing-around-the-individual&quot;&gt;Optimizing around the individual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t humanly calculate the optimal giving experience for all of your donors in your lifetime, let alone on the fly. But machines can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where artificial intelligence enters the picture. You can task an AI with answering a question like, “how much should Donor X give?” and given enough data, that AI will provide a logical answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle applies at scale, too, which means you can gather a lot of actionable insights about your donors within a short timespan. The trick is completing this exercise over and over again very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, machines can help. If you leave an AI to answer your questions automatically, it will dutifully carry out the task around the clock. This is the only way to meaningfully optimize anything around an individual in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, one size does not fit all, so even if one $5K donor covers the transaction fees for their donation, it doesn’t mean that subsequent $5K donors will also cover the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properties like time of day, location, proximity to a payday, cell phone carrier and even mouse cursor movements are all factors in whether the fees get covered on a donor’s gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;implementing-ai-for-fee-coverage&quot;&gt;Implementing AI for fee coverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With adaptive cost coverage feature, you’re harnessing AI to observe over 100 properties that orbit every potential donor. This exercise in observation occurs nonstop to account for moment-to-moment behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that you get a very good idea of who should be asked to cover transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our hallmark statistics over the years has been that on average, 92% of donors cover fees. Admittedly, that number is likely to drop as nonprofits begin switching over to adaptive cost coverage. But this is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? You’re now optimizing for conversion instead of broader fee coverage. You might see fewer donors covering transaction fees, but you are likely to see more giving and larger donation sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, early results indicate a 5% conversion increase when adaptive cost coverage is enabled and a roughly 4% elevation in revenue throughout. This is a big win for you and for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core objective in partnering with you will always be optimizing conversion. Because the easier it is for someone to extend their generosity toward your mission, the closer you get to fulfilling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now toggle seven new recurring donation frequencies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to one-time and monthly options, Checkout now supports daily, weekly, biweekly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual donation frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new frequencies add flexibility to how you fundraise. For example, if you’re a Muslim organization fundraising during Ramadan, you can use the daily giving frequency to enable donors to make an automatic donation during each day of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you have a fundraising strategy that taps donors for larger but less frequent gifts, options like semiannual and annual frequencies make it easy for these supporters to opt-in to greater giving directly on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re hyper-focused on testing or segmentation, you can even create multiple Checkout instances, each with unique donation frequencies configured to evaluate which frequencies perform best with your various donor groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initially including nonprofits in the scope of its &lt;a href=&quot;/3b354af3833042abacfffe9f51678a1a&quot;&gt;new subscription billing rules&lt;/a&gt;, Mastercard has now confirmed with Fundraise Up that the company will largely exempt nonprofits from the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an October 11, 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/hubfs/Hosted/Mastercard/m_an6977_en_us.pdf&quot;&gt;bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, Mastercard included the carve-out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“…all requirements will now only apply to non-profit and charity merchants that are identified for at least four months in the ACMP.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACMP is a Mastercard program designed to identify and mitigate high chargeback rates amongst merchants. Nonprofits that experience high chargeback rates and are enrolled in ACMP or a similar Mastercard program are still required to follow the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all other nonprofits, the rules are now described as “best practice recommendations” by Mastercard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rules, which apply to merchants around the world, are active as of September 22, 2022. &lt;a href=&quot;/709b5382014b49dcb795a557578870dd&quot;&gt;The March 21, 2022 extension for nonprofits&lt;/a&gt; is no longer in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up, which is a Mastercard preferred partner, has worked with the financial services company since August to address concerns within the nonprofit industry about how the new rules impact nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastercard says that collaborations with Fundraise Up and organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnpa.org/&quot;&gt;The Nonprofit Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (which also &lt;a href=&quot;https://tnpa.org/mastercard/&quot;&gt;voiced concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the rules to Mastercard) helped pave the way for the new exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Fundraise Up customers, this latest update from Mastercard does not require any action to be taken. The advanced notice email that was added to the platform to satisfy rule requirements will remain but be toggled-off by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this update or others regarding Mastercard’s subscription billing rules, email me at nic@fundraiseup.com.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your story. &lt;/strong&gt;Get together with your team to brainstorm ways to compel people to donate to your campaign. Who will benefit from the campaign, and what impact stories can you share in your digital communications?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set your promotion schedule. &lt;/strong&gt;Decide which digital channels to promote GivingTuesday on and when you will be launching those communications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;build-out-your-emails&quot;&gt;Build out your emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set your email marketing plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Identify how many emails you want to send between now and November 29. We recommend that you diversify to include non-appeals — like a touching story or an impact update — so that not every email is an ask. Need help establishing your email timeline? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextafter.com/year-end-fundraising-email-timeline/&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a helpful resource from NextAfter →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment your email lists.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you decide what types of emails you will send leading up to and on GivingTuesday, it&amp;#39;s time to build out your email lists. How you categorize your lists will depend on your organization, but a few ideas are to segment by type of supporter, cause area, and past campaign activity. Want tips on email segmentation? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholewhale.com/tips/email-segmentation-nonprofits/&quot;&gt;Check out this resource from WholeWhale →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preschedule your email sends.&lt;/strong&gt; To save you time and stress leading up to GivingTuesday, build out your emails and schedule them in advance so you can focus more mission-critical activities on November 29.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;get-social-ready&quot;&gt;Get social ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create different types of social posts to promote GivingTuesday.&lt;/strong&gt; Brainstorm creative ideas on how to share the news about GivingTuesday on your social channels. Be sure to include organic and paid social posts, and always include a call-to-action button that links back to your GivingTuesday campaign. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcsocialmarketing.com/2021/09/8-social-media-ideas-to-boost-your-year-end-giving/&quot;&gt;Julia Campbell shares social media ideas to boost year-end giving in this resource →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preschedule social posts for GivingTuesday. I&lt;/strong&gt;f you have a social media management tool, like Hootsuite, consider scheduling your social posts in advance so they&amp;#39;re ready to go live on
GivingTuesday without any additional effort on your part.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As donors receive exemplary and personalized experiences with their favorite brands — like Amazon and Netflix — they’ve come to expect that same level of thoughtfulness when they donate to charitable causes. In fact, research finds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/?sh=272c2dc2a942&quot;&gt;91% of consumers&lt;/a&gt; say they are more likely to shop with brands that provide recommendations that are relevant to them, which is also applicable to donors and nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet changing donor preferences and to customize giving for every campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/new-checkout-frequencies/&quot;&gt;Fundraise Up released seven additional recurring giving frequencies:&lt;/a&gt; daily, weekly, biweekly, bimonthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along as we share how nonprofits can use additional giving levels to unlock more generosity from donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;special-holidays&quot;&gt;Special holidays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During special holidays, many donors commemorate by giving back to their favorite charitable causes. So why not give them more options to show their support? If you’re launching a holiday campaign, encourage donors to give on a more frequent basis. That way, you’re empowering them with a more meaningful way to celebrate the holidays while also increasing the revenue potential for your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese New Year: &lt;/strong&gt;In anticipation of the new moon, people all over the world celebrate Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, with a 15-day spring festival. Encourage daily recurring donations as a way for your donors to celebrate the new year and give back to the AAPI community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramadan:&lt;/strong&gt; A religious holiday observed by Muslims all over the world, Ramadan is a time of reflection, fasting, and prayer. Bring your community closer by opening up daily giving and even weekly giving. We recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/4-tips-p2p-perfect/&quot;&gt;adding a goal meter&lt;/a&gt; so that your supporters can keep track of your campaign performance throughout the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passover, Rosh Hashanah &amp;amp; Hanukkah: &lt;/strong&gt;For these important multiday Jewish holidays, offer daily as a recurring giving option to those who wish to increase their giving during these timeframes. Here’s a fun idea: Why not add a popup message as soon as someone enters your website to encourage more frequent giving for those who are celebrating?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diwali:&lt;/strong&gt; A five-day celebration, Diwali is a religious Hindu festival. To give back to their communities, those celebrating may want to increase their support — so it’s a good idea to make daily giving an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmas: &lt;/strong&gt;As a way for donors to give back to their communities during the holiday season, offer up daily or weekly giving starting December 1 and ending December 25. Want to incentivize more people to donate? Add an impact slider so donors know how their donation is making a difference (e.g., $20 provides meals for a pet in need for an entire week).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kwanzaa: &lt;/strong&gt;For those celebrating the African-American culture during Kwanzaa at the end of December, empower donors to give daily. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/donor-map-element/&quot;&gt;Include a donor map&lt;/a&gt; on your website so donors can see where fellow supporters are giving from.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;month-long-awareness-campaigns&quot;&gt;Month-long awareness campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With important monthly observances and celebrations throughout the year — such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month, and Pride Month — it’s a good opportunity to raise awareness about issues important to your organization and generate additional donation revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer your donors one of three recurring frequency options during month-long campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily: &lt;/strong&gt;For donors who want to show their support every day of your campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly: &lt;/strong&gt;For donors who might not be able to give daily but still want to give frequently throughout the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bi-weekly: &lt;/strong&gt;For&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;donors who want to make a bigger impact than just a one-time gift&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;flexible-plans-for-changing-donor-lifestyles&quot;&gt;Flexible plans for changing donor lifestyles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things don’t go as planned and donors are faced with budget constraints. If you’re only offering a monthly giving option, chances are you’ll end up with a lapsed donor who cancels their recurring giving plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more flexible options like bi-monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and annual gifts, your organization is now able to better retain donors and customize a giving plan that works with your donor’s lifestyle, no matter what happens. With Fundraise Up’s Donor Portal, your donor can change their giving frequency at any time and pick back up where they left off when they’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;

In showing their appreciation and gratitude]]></description><link>https://fundraiseup.com/blog/tribute-gifts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fundraiseup.com/blog/tribute-gifts</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bf32f96a-5019-4d01-a8f8-63ba3162247f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the holiday season draws closer, people will be looking to give back to their communities by making donations to their favorite charitable organizations. In showing their appreciation and gratitude for the work your organization has done throughout the year, many will want to dedicate their donation to someone special in their life as a way to honor them during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;tribute-gifts-as-a-way-to-honor-loved-ones&quot;&gt;Tribute gifts as a way to honor loved ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribute gifts are another way for your organization to raise funds during the year-end season but also throughout the entire year. Allowing someone to dedicate a donation is a remarkable way for donors to celebrate important milestones with their loved ones like holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations. But it’s also a way to show support and honor someone who is struggling or grieving through personal hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of a nonprofit leveraging tribute gifts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unfpa.org/donate/tribute&quot;&gt;United Nations Population Fund&lt;/a&gt; has created a landing page that educates donors about what tribute gifts are and how these gifts are able to support women and girls in need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d319027e-bcf5-4f59-b611-80137d364438/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to add more clarity around how donors can make a tribute gift, you can highlight steps to take on your landing page. Make sure the how-to section is in a prominent location on your landing page so that donors don’t miss it. That way, there’s complete transparency around dedicating their donation, and they won’t miss it during checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you’re using a donation platform like Fundraise Up, the steps could read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To dedicate your donation to a loved one, click on the donate button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the donation as normal but remember to check the “Dedicate this donation” box and type the name of the person you want to donate on behalf of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the rest of the donation steps and don’t forget to customize an email card at the end of the donation process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it a step further by highlighting the steps in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/engage-with-popup/&quot;&gt;a popup message&lt;/a&gt; so that it’s the first thing donors see when they enter your tribute-specific landing page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ba129407-a3e4-4a79-86ff-984762409f06&gt;Engaging tribute donors and recipients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tribute gifts are a way to grow online revenue, it also serves as an opportunity to increase your brand awareness and ability to garner new supporters. When someone makes a tribute gift, they are either a first-time donor who is offering their support to a cause that is important to someone special in their life or a returning donor who is offering their support to a cause that is important to them on behalf of someone special in their life. In either case, your organization is given an opportunity to cultivate a new donor through strategic relationship-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways to nurture that relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send a thank-you email. &lt;/strong&gt;You should always send a thank-you email to the donor as soon as they make a gift to your organization. This lets the donor know that you appreciate their support and makes them feel good about their gesture of good will. By using a donation platform like Fundraise Up, you’re able to customize thank-you emails so that they automatically trigger once a donation is processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share how their gift has made a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s the donor or the recipient who is new to your organization, be sure to send them a follow-up email after your year-end campaign to tell them how their donation has impacted your work. For instance, if you’re raising funds to bring school supplies to children who need it most, let them know how many kids you were able to help and how they contributed to that impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell compelling stories.&lt;/strong&gt; Share personal stories about the people, animals, or environment your mission supports. A thoughtful story about an individual person, animal, or place can help donors emotionally connect with those you serve. If the donor feels good about the difference they’re helping you make, it might even inspire the donor to give again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask them to become a recurring supporter. &lt;/strong&gt;Tell the donor about your recurring giving program. Explain how they can make a bigger difference on your mission by taking their next one-time donation and spreading it across recurring gifts throughout the year. This will boost revenue but also donor retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage them to create a fundraiser in your year-end campaign. &lt;/strong&gt;Rally your community of supporters and share how much it would mean to your organization if they started a fundraiser for your campaign. It only takes a few minutes &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/3-must-have-peer-to-peer/&quot;&gt;to create or join a fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; on Fundraise Up, and they immediately get a personalized link to share in their social channels or via email.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;offering-a-dedication-option-in-your-donation-experience&quot;&gt;Offering a dedication option in your donation experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up makes dedicating donations to someone simple, quick, and effortless for your donor. If your donor wants to make a dedication, all they have to do is check the “Dedicate this donation” box on the checkout screen and complete their donation as they normally would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your donor completes their donation, they have the option to send a personalized card or make another dedication. When a donor sends a card, they have the option to choose a dedication type — in honor of or in memory of a loved one. Then, they can customize the message they want to send and choose artwork from your image collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up has created seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/images-for-tributes/&quot;&gt;image collections&lt;/a&gt; that you can offer to your donors: memorial, celebration, thank you, anniversary, birthday, wedding and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ee747190-313c-40fe-9802-098f5c044bdf/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have the option to customize your own image collection for any given campaign. You can select up to four images per collection, and individual collections can be included or excluded from a campaign. For example, if you’re creating a holiday-themed image collection just for your year-end campaign, you can choose to include that collection in that campaign, and the image collection would not be shown in any other campaign running on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a graphic designer on staff who can create custom images to use for tribute gifts, that’s fantastic. However, for organizations that don’t, there are a number of free to low-cost resources out there to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/&quot;&gt;Pexels&lt;/a&gt; offers hundreds of thousands stock photos to use and attribution is not required. And it’s all free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shutterstock.com/&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt; offers a library of more than 300 million stock photos to choose from. Pricing for plans range from $49 to $479+ a month, and all plans come with worry-free licensing and legal protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2/&quot;&gt;DALL·E 2&lt;/a&gt; is an AI art generation tool that can create unique images and art from a general description. You can use DALL·E 2 for free for three months with an $18 credit — then you can pay as you go with its token model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in time for year-end, we’ve compiled a library of free images that you can offer to your tribute donors to personalize their dedication cards. &lt;a href=&quot;https://engage.fundraiseup.com/hubfs/Assets/Fundraise%20Up%20Year-End%20Image%20Collection.zip&quot;&gt;Download our year-end collection here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;ℹ️&quot; class=&quot;callout blue_background&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why so many hashtags?&lt;/strong&gt;
Posts with the highest engagement on Instagram typically include 20-30 hashtags.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include the link to your crypto checkout in your post. This will generate a rich link on social media platforms that includes an image and an easy-to-click link preview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t link to your crypto checkout, include an image with your post. Posts that include images gain 53% more likes and 104% more comments than posts without them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a strategic time to email or post your announcement. Here are the best times to consider:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; Between 10 AM and between 3 and 4 PM on Tuesdays (best), Wednesdays (better), or Mondays (good)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; Between 9 AM and 1 PM on Tuesdays, Wednesday, or Fridays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Between 11 AM and 2 PM on Tuesdays, or 11 AM during any other day of the workweek&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 8 AM on Mondays or Thursdays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn:&lt;/strong&gt; 9 AM on Tuesdays and Wednesdays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nonprofit, you’re constantly looking for ways to expand your gift options to engage more donors and raise more for your mission. As newer, more modern donation payment methods continue to emerge, it can be difficult to distinguish which ones are right for your nonprofit. One gift option you might not want to overlook is stock donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re seeing stock donations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/business/elon-musk-charity-donation/index.html&quot;&gt;make its way into mainstream media&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps your organization has even gotten requests from supporters about it — you’re now wondering if stocks are a viable option for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about stock donations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What to know about the stock market and its investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why nonprofits should consider adding stock donations as a gift option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to include in your gift acceptance policy regarding stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to accept stock donations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;the-stock-market--its-investors&quot;&gt;The stock market &amp;amp; its investors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, stocks are an investment that represent ownership shares of the issuing company. Because stocks increase in value over time, they are considered appreciated non-cash assets — like real estate, mutual funds, or bonds — making stocks a more valuable investment than cash. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloomerang.co/blog/asking-for-stock-gifts-boosts-nonprofit-contributions/&quot;&gt;according to a study by Dr. Russell James JD, PhD, CFP,&lt;/a&gt; cash makes up less than 10% of the collective assets and wealth owned by Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/research/how-many-americans-own-stock/&quot;&gt;145 million Americans who own stock,&lt;/a&gt; with the average family holding about $40,000 worth of stocks. While stocks are owned by families of all income levels, the number of stocks owned &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx&quot;&gt;is more prevalent in wealthier families&lt;/a&gt;. Of the Americans who own stock, the majority make more than $100,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=62940b90-b6e5-4cd6-8482-580e334d474c&gt;Why donate stock instead of cash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people donate their stock options to nonprofits because they want to support a noble cause, the larger reason is that gifting stock comes with tax benefits for the donor. Because stocks are considered property, when an investor’s stock increases in value, so do the taxes they owe on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the donor has had the investment for under a year, they may be subject to &lt;a href=&quot;https://monumentwealthmanagement.com/resource/is-donating-stock-to-charity-the-way-to-go/#:~:text=Types%20of%20stocks%20you%20can,cost%20basis%20for%20the%20donation.&quot;&gt;short-term tax treatment,&lt;/a&gt; which means they can only deduct the original value of their stock asset. However, if the donor’s stock investment has been appreciating for more than a year, they avoid paying capital gains taxes. This greatly benefits the nonprofit because without having capital gains taxes taken out of the donation, the nonprofit receives the entire intended donation. Plus, the donor is eligible for a tax deduction based on the fair market value at the time of the donation, offering more of an incentive for donating stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;why-nonprofits-should-accept-stock-donations&quot;&gt;Why nonprofits should accept stock donations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nonprofits consider adding stock as a donation option to diversify their payment portfolio. Giving donors the option to choose how they can donate to your organization increases the chance of conversion because you’re meeting more donors’ giving preferences. For example, if your nonprofit only offered credit cards as a payment option, odds are you’re losing out on potential donations. Research shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ppro.com/news/retailers-risk-losing-customers/#:~:text=Today%2C%20PPRO%20announces%20research%20findings,to%20address%20consumers%27%20payment%20preferences.&quot;&gt;42% of US consumers abandon a purchase&lt;/a&gt; if their favorite payment method isn’t available, which could be compared to donation abandonment as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, your organization can significantly boost fundraising revenue by just adding an option to donate stock. In the same study conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloomerang.co/blog/asking-for-stock-gifts-boosts-nonprofit-contributions/&quot;&gt;Dr. Russell James JD, PhD, CFP,&lt;/a&gt; it was found that nonprofits promoting and receiving are seeing a 55% growth in donations compared to nonprofits only accepting cash donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=5085ed27-4217-4a69-ab75-664d95340a84&gt;Connect with more major donors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits that offer stock donations are better positioning themselves to connect with wealthier individuals who have a higher capacity to give. In fact, these major donors are contributing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebrumberg/2020/12/01/stock-donations-7-essentials-to-maximize-your-charitable-giving--tax-deduction/?sh=1f839bee53c0&quot;&gt;more than $21 billion in stock&lt;/a&gt; every year to their favorite charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While stock donors want to give back to their communities, they also want to make financially smart decisions. Donating stock checks both of those boxes for them. So, if you&amp;#39;re not making it easy for these major donors to donate stock using your nonprofit&amp;#39;s website, you&amp;#39;re missing out on valuable donors and leaving revenue on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;adding-stock-to-your-gift-acceptance-policy&quot;&gt;Adding stock to your gift acceptance policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start accepting stock donations, it’s important to take the necessary steps to protect your organization from any potential risks and liabilities. That’s where your nonprofit’s gift acceptance policy comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highly recommend including the following information in your updated gift acceptance policy, which explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The types of stock you can accept: &lt;/strong&gt;Explain what types of stocks you will be accepting (e.g., publicly traded stocks, mutual funds, or privately held stocks) and which brokerages you’re working with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you will be processing stocks: &lt;/strong&gt;Your donors will want to know whether you will liquidate stock donations immediately or retain them to appreciate over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is eligible to give a stock donation: &lt;/strong&gt;While anyone who owns stock is eligible to donate, it might be a good idea to outline that a donor avoids paying capital gains taxes if the asset they are intending to donate has been appreciating for at least a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock donations are non-refundable: &lt;/strong&gt;Make it clear in your gift acceptance policy that stock donations are non-refundable. While most donors won’t change their mind, this gives your organization an extra layer of protection from any donor who decides to take back their stock donation after making the gift. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;ways-to-accept-stock-donations&quot;&gt;Ways to accept stock donations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, people who wanted to donate stock to their favorite nonprofit had to go through a manual process that takes a lot of time and effort. That process could look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The donor contacts their nonprofit of choice and finds out if they accept stock donations. If the answer is yes, then the nonprofit provides the donor its account and brokerage information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donor then has to contact the brokerage to obtain the necessary donation forms. The brokerage might even ask for additional information from the nonprofit, like a medallion stamp guarantee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donor then fills out the forms and starts the transfer to the nonprofit&amp;#39;s account. Once completed, the brokerage will provide the donor with a reference number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The donor contacts the nonprofit to let it know that the stock donation has been initiated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ensure the nonprofit received the donation, the donor has to check in daily until they receive confirmation from the nonprofit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that nonprofits no longer have to go through such a tedious and time-consuming effort just to get a single stock donation. Now, there are new technology solutions entering the fold, like Fundraise Up, that are helping to facilitate and streamline the stock donation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other stock donation platforms can take up to an entire week to approve a transaction, Fundraise Up is able to confirm stocks are available prior to the donor giving a stock donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=dddf2bdf-0cd3-4664-8ad1-e20c327274af&gt;Integrating stock as a donation payment option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/stock-giving/&quot;&gt;your nonprofit can accept stock just like any other type of donation&lt;/a&gt; — like credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets, and crypto — and your donor’s experience remains as personalized and seamless as ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is simple: your nonprofit accepts the stock donation from the donor, Fundraise Up processes the paperwork and works with their preferred brokerage, and then we store the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/67d932f7-8ffc-4602-a3af-8b563bdc57b6/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your donor has a specific brokerage they like to use, we can work with their preferred brokerage to process their stock donation. Fundraise Up can accept stock donations from more than 1,000 brokerages including Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, you can remove uncertainty from the stock donation equation knowing that Fundraise Up provides secure and compliant stock donation processing. Not only is Fundraise Up SOC II compliance, which adheres to stringent security practices to provide protection for your nonprofit&amp;#39;s data, we also are &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/medallion-signature-guarantee/&quot;&gt;the only platform that ensures a Medallion Signature Guarantee.&lt;/a&gt; This allows Fundraise Up to process stock donations up to $1 million for our nonprofits that choose to accept stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medallionsignatureguarantee.asp&quot;&gt;Medallion Signature Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;, a difficult and costly certification to obtain, certifies that a signature that authorizes the transfer of securities is authentic. This is typically a required step in the stock donation process done by the nonprofit. However, nonprofits can rest easy and trust that Fundraise Up will do the hard work to ensure that every stock donation is valid and authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 10th anniversary of the global day of generosity. A movement started in 2012 by a nonprofit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.92ny.org/&quot;&gt;92nd Street Y&lt;/a&gt;, GivingTuesday is an annual event that occurs the Tuesday following Thanksgiving. Similar to the way Black Friday and Cyber Monday are used to encourage consumers to shop at their favorite brands, GivingTuesday encourages donors to give back to charitable causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generosity has poured in over the years on GivingTuesday, with an estimated 35 million Americans participating last year and raising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/millions-of-people-come-together-to-celebrate-generosity-share-kindness-and-drive-record-breaking-giving-on-givingtuesday-2021/&quot;&gt;a record $2.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; collectively. With the potential of total giving reaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wholewhale.com/tips/givingtuesday-stats-and-facts/&quot;&gt;over $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; this year on November 29, GivingTuesday presents nonprofits with a big opportunity to fine-tune their digital campaigns to further engage donors and increase year-end revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re in the middle of GivingTuesday planning or have yet to start, the first step is to always do the prep work before launching your campaign so that you have a succession plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign planning can look different for every organization, but the most crucial steps are to define your campaign’s purpose and objectives, figure out how you will tell your story to compel people to donate, establish which digital channels you’ll communicate with your donors through, and set your promotion schedule leading up to and on GivingTuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you along the way, we’ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/2022-gt-checklist/&quot;&gt;a digital campaign checklist&lt;/a&gt; that can act as your guide between now and GivingTuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;website-content&quot;&gt;Website content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website will lay the foundation for all of your digital communications for your campaign. It’s where you’ll house information about your campaign, where people will go to learn more about you as an organization, and where you’ll direct your calls to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your website plays a pivotal role in donor engagement. Providing a captivating website experience will dictate whether or not someone will feel moved enough to donate to your GivingTuesday campaign. Here are four critical website elements that you shouldn’t overlook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place your donate button in a prominent location on your homepage. &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t bury your donate button in a hard-to-find place. It should be the first thing a website visitor sees so that when they’re ready to donate, you’ll convert them into a donor immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect your GivingTuesday campaign directly to a call-to-action button. &lt;/strong&gt;Highlight your campaign in the featured section of your website. Additionally, when someone clicks on your donate button, make sure they are directly taken to your donation checkout and not another landing page. This prevents any friction in the donation process and ensures that the intended donor can easily give.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage monthly support in the donation checkout. &lt;/strong&gt;While GivingTuesday is notorious for one-time donations, what’s stopping your nonprofit from also getting monthly support? Organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/animal-haven&quot;&gt;Animal Haven&lt;/a&gt; have tripled their recurring revenue by including an upsell in their donation checkout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering more payment options.&lt;/strong&gt; Convert more donors by giving them more payment options to choose from. Your donors have different giving preferences — why not meet them where they are? By limiting your options to credit cards and bank transfers, you could be missing out on additional revenue. Fundraise Up offers a wide range of payment options that includes credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/crypto-guide/&quot;&gt;crypto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/stock-donations-guide/&quot;&gt;stock giving.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I would highly recommend not cutting out sustaining gifts as an option on GivingTuesday. We convert donors every year who come to give a one-time donation and are upsold to becoming monthly donors. And as we all know in the industry, your sustaining donors have a longer lifetime value and automatic retention built in,” &lt;strong&gt;Shannon McLaughlin-Kirkman, Director of Development, Communications, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://animalhaven.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal Haven,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/givingtuesday-playbook&quot;&gt;a recent live session on GivingTuesday.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that the scale of any nonprofit’s GivingTuesday campaign will vary from organization to organization. Knowing what works for your organization will help you build an effective campaign that will drive revenue. And because there’s still time before the big day, it’s an opportune time to test out new fundraising tactics to see if you can garner even more engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other ideas to try out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a descriptive landing page for your GivingTuesday campaign.&lt;/strong&gt; A landing page serves as an information hub for everything about your GivingTuesday campaign. There, you can make your case for support — what your campaign is raising funds for and why people should make a donation — for those people who might be interested in giving but need a little more convincing. Consider adding interactive elements on your landing page to keep people up to date with campaign performance — like a goal meter, cause areas to support, and a leaderboard of top supporters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://give.ropsi.org/givingtuesday&quot;&gt;See a live example here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a popup message that overlays on your homepage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/engage-with-popup/&quot;&gt;A popup message&lt;/a&gt; ensures that the first thing a website visitor sees is a call to action leading them to your GivingTuesday campaign. This guarantees that your campaign won’t get overlooked and people know what your immediate need is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let supporters create fundraisers. &lt;/strong&gt;Want to boost revenue even more this year? Give your supporters &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/3-must-have-peer-to-peer/&quot;&gt;a way to create fundraisers on behalf of your organization.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a way to bring your community together, and supporters can choose to create a new fundraiser or join a team fundraiser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;email-communications&quot;&gt;Email communications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is by far the preferred way to communicate, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats#highlight&quot;&gt;4 billion daily email users.&lt;/a&gt; Most nonprofits leverage this digital channel to communicate with their constituents. Research finds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-benchmarks/&quot;&gt;the average open rate for nonprofits is 26.6%,&lt;/a&gt; which is higher when compared to other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can you effectively use email marketing to promote your GivingTuesday campaign? Here are the steps you should consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan your email marketing. &lt;/strong&gt;How many emails will you send between now and November 29? Know what works best with your audience, but also remember that donors will expect an increased number of emails leading up to GivingTuesday and year-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment your lists.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t send generic emails to your entire list. Personalize your emails and segment your lists in a way that makes sense for your audience — whether it’s by type of supporter, interest areas, or past campaign activity. Keep in mind that personalized emails &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/ultimate-guide-email-marketing-nonprofits/&quot;&gt;generate up to six times more donations&lt;/a&gt; compared to generalized emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-schedule your email sends. &lt;/strong&gt;Make it easier on your team on GivingTuesday by creating and scheduling your emails in advance. This will help avoid additional stress and last-minute rushing on the important day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify your e-communications. &lt;/strong&gt;While appeals are important and will be a big part of your GivingTuesday email campaign, consider diversifying your email content so that not every email donors receive is an ask. Consider including emails about the impact donors are helping your organization make and individual stories about the people, animals, or environment you serve. And remember to include a call to action in all of your emails — whether it’s directing donors to make a donation, to learn more about what you’re doing for GivingTuesday, or to read up on your mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It’s important that you pay attention to what your audience is doing, when and where they like to hear from you, and when they don’t like to hear from you. Look at your open rates, click rates, and response rates from the past few years. You can A/B test if you haven’t before.” &lt;strong&gt;— Shannon McLaughlin-Kirkman, Director of Development, Communications, Animal Haven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;social-media-outreach&quot;&gt;Social media outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/how-many-people-use-social-media&quot;&gt;more than 4 billion people in the world who use social media,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.candid.org/post/five-tips-to-get-you-ready-for-a-social-media-giving-day/#:~:text=Nonprofit%20Source%20found%20that%2055,food%2C%20or%20other%20personal%20items.&quot;&gt;55% of individuals who engage with nonprofits on social media end up taking action&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t miss the opportunity to attract new and existing donors by doing social media outreach for your upcoming campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips for leveraging social media this GivingTuesday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the right platforms. &lt;/strong&gt;With so many social media platforms out there, understand that you don’t need to be on every platform to have a successful social strategy. Know the platforms your donors are most engaged in and focus on those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the right mix of content. &lt;/strong&gt;Do a deep dive into your social channels. Find the posts that get the most engagement from your audience and see if you can identify a pattern. This could vary from platform to platform, so understand what works well for each and push out those types of posts come GivingTuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct people back to your website. &lt;/strong&gt;Be sure to include a call to action that links back to your website. Remember, that’s where all of your important content lives and where people will go to make a donation to your campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive engagement from your followers. &lt;/strong&gt;Always prompt your followers to take action in your social posts. Whether it’s asking them to donate to your campaign, create a fundraiser, or simply share the post with their followers, it’s a good opportunity to get user-generated content and expand your reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“We look at our organic social media as a place where we’re telling our story for the first time… We’re not banking on people having seen our email campaigns when they land on our social posts on GivingTuesday, so it’s really important to tell vivid, colorful stories so you can make people feel.” — &lt;strong&gt;Shannon McLaughlin-Kirkman, Director of Development, Communications, Animal Haven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year when many nonprofit organizations are preparing to launch their year-end giving fundraising campaigns. The year-end season — between &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/2022-gt-checklist/&quot;&gt;GivingTuesday&lt;/a&gt; and December 31 — accounts for &lt;a href=&quot;https://neonone.com/resources/blog/year-end-giving-statistics/&quot;&gt;more than one-third of annual giving&lt;/a&gt;. Given how important this time of the year is, leadership and operational teams are working together to strategize, build, and optimize their fundraising campaigns to engage more donors and grow revenue during the year-end season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preparation spans across marketing, fundraising, donor development, IT, leadership and other teams working in collaboration to make it all happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up is a critical piece of this puzzle helping convert intentions to donations. The platform enables nonprofits to maximize their impact by equipping teams with a donation experience and interactive website elements made to convert donors and increase donation volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we kick off year-end, Fundraise Up is rolling out a number of resources that include best fundraising practices, user data across channels, as well as some of our new features with advanced capabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are a few checklist items that you should be thinking about to make the most of your year-end fundraising campaign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaign-specific landing pages:&lt;/strong&gt; Create landing pages specific to your GivingTuesday and year-end campaigns so donors understand what you’re fundraising for and how they can offer their support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified experience:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fundraise Up checkout is designed to move someone with an intent to give to someone who gives. We recommend leveraging Fundraise Up on every channel you engage donors in — website, email, ads, social, direct mail, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Fundraise Up has always strived to meet any donor wherever they are. To that extent, payment methods play a key role in donor conversion. Fundraise Up offers credit card, bank transfer, digital wallet, crypto, and stock payment options. If you don’t have some of these turned on, now might be a good time to enable them to meet any donor preference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose from 20+ of Fundraise Up’s interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/elements/&quot;&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; to create engaging landing pages on your website. Our elements are plug and play and can be easily embedded without a developer on staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks:&lt;/strong&gt; Accept stock and unlock donations worth more than 70x cash gifts. Using Fundraise Up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/stock-giving/&quot;&gt;you can now accept stock donations&lt;/a&gt; through an easy online process and feel safe and secure with our Medallion Signature Guarantee — a program that is used to authorize high-value stock transfers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrency:&lt;/strong&gt; Crypto donations are on the rise. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/crypto-guide/&quot;&gt;crypto owners holding more than $1 trillion in assets,&lt;/a&gt; many nonprofits have demonstrated interest in enabling this type of donation. It’s an optimal time to turn the crypto payment option on in Fundraise Up and attract more major donors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see these features in action, Fundraise Up’s demo website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ropsi.org/&quot;&gt;ROPSI,&lt;/a&gt; provides clear live examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the above pointers are simple and quick to implement and can have an immense impact on your fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be delivering additional resources in the form of email series, live sessions, and outreach from our Customer Success team. Our &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@fundraiseup.com&quot;&gt;Support &lt;/a&gt;team is always on standby during this busy period for any help you may need during this critical time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The busiest time of the year for giving has arrived, which kicked into high gear on GivingTuesday and will go all the way to the last of the year — December 31. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://neonone.com/resources/blog/year-end-giving-statistics/&quot;&gt;more than a third of annual giving occurring in December&lt;/a&gt; and 12% of total donations received on the last three days of the year, many nonprofits prep their campaigns months in advance in hopes of exceeding their revenue goals for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a time of the year when generosity is at its highest, we’ve seen December giving grow significantly year over year. Looking at this year’s GivingTuesday, US &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenonprofittimes.com/npt_articles/givingtuesday-added-3-1-billion-to-u-s-nonprofit-coffers/&quot;&gt;nonprofits collectively raised $3.1 billion,&lt;/a&gt; a 15% increase from 2021 and 25% from 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data at Fundraise Up also shows a notable uptick in December giving from 2020 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/64eb590b-8bdc-4529-aa30-70fd9e4410c4/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving trends from January 1, 2020 to October 1, 2022 with notable jumps in December 2020, December 2021, and March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;how-a-forecasted-recession-might-affect-year-end-giving&quot;&gt;How a forecasted recession might affect year-end giving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With high inflation rates and fears of a coming recession, many are concerned about how these economic factors will impact charitable giving. While we won’t make any predictions about what is to come, what we can do is look back at past economic downturns to understand what to expect for the remainder of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic caused both a public health and economic crisis, but what we saw was that the generosity of Americans never wavered. In fact, Americans gave an all-time high of $488 billion in 2020. And despite surging inflation rates following the pandemic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/americans-gave-a-near-record-485-billion-to-charity-in-2021-despite-surging-inflation-rates-185086&quot;&gt;US giving only slightly dipped in 2021 totaling $485 billion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the possibility of a recession enters the fold, what we’ve learned from the past is that people have more reasons to give to charitable causes because of the increased need. Research from Fidelity Charitable finds that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/despite-fears-of-a-recession-many-may-give-more-to-charity.html&quot;&gt;59% of donors may be willing to give more this year&lt;/a&gt; — with a majority concerned about nonprofits amid threats of a recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your organization is concerned about a slight dip in giving this year-end, now is the time to focus on improving your donation experience. With so many people browsing the web looking for ways to give back this holiday season, it’s your chance to catch the attention of these website visitors and convert them into donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;double-down-on-the-giving-experience&quot;&gt;Double down on the giving experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research at Fundraise Up tells us that seven in 100 donors actually click a donate button, and of those people, only one will complete their donation. This high abandonment rate is caused by points of friction in the donation process, such as page load time, too many data fields to fill out, generic giving levels, limited payment options, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are supporters who will fill out lengthy donation forms and give to nonprofits, these organizations are not tapping into the potential of how much donors could give if the experience was better optimized, quick, and simple to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore this a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, your donors are already receiving personalized and simplified online experiences with their favorite brands. These are the brands that your donors are loyal to and will return to time and time again. To garner this type of loyalty, nonprofits need to consider the quality of these experiences and find ways to mirror them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you still have time before December 31, but time is moving quickly so now is the time to evaluate your nonprofit’s current donation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long does it take to complete a donation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there too many required data fields?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a recurring giving option so that one-time donors can upgrade their contributions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you offer multiple payment options other than using a credit card — like digital wallets, crypto giving, and stock giving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is every donor receiving the same experience — generic messaging, donation asks, and payment options?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f69ba1ab-aa5c-497b-8fa0-9c72ab8c116c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Your donors deserve a unique giving experience. When donors know their experience was tailored specifically for them, you build trust with them and they will want to play a bigger role in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Fundraise Up, we understand how your organization can cater to every donor’s preference. That’s why we optimize the giving experience with your donor in mind to include personalized donation asks and payment methods based on device or geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/giving-tuesday-digital-channels/&quot;&gt;GivingTuesday&lt;/a&gt;! The big day has finally arrived, and it’s time to see the fruit of all your labor come to life. But the hard work doesn’t stop here —  today marks the beginning of a very busy year-end giving season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your team has to stay alert today to ensure &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/2022-gt-checklist/&quot;&gt;everything goes according to plan&lt;/a&gt; and also consider how it can &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/tribute-gifts/&quot;&gt;keep building momentum&lt;/a&gt; without causing donor fatigue until December 31 to hit its year-end revenue goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with your year-end planning, we’re sharing five GivingTuesday campaigns you can pull inspiration from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-rainforest-trust-matching-gift-campaign&quot;&gt;1. Rainforest Trust: Matching-gift campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further incentivize donors to make a donation on GivingTuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rainforesttrust.org/giving-tuesday-2022/&quot;&gt;Rainforest Trust&lt;/a&gt; is running a matching-gift campaign. The organization features the campaign front and center on its website and in donation checkout, ensuring that donors don’t miss out on this opportunity to make 3x the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a campaign-specific landing page provides donors with additional information about what you’re doing for GivingTuesday and why it matters. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://ally.org/giving-tuesday&quot;&gt;Ally Global Foundation’s GivingTuesday landing page,&lt;/a&gt; the organization highlights how it plans to help at-risk children in Nepal and shares moving stories to encourage donor support. It also includes multiple calls to action across the page and a goal meter so supporters can stay informed about campaign performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5cf1f793-35b3-4c9f-9a69-4ab77b253e2d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-american-heart-association-ways-to-support&quot;&gt;3. American Heart Association: Ways to support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage new supporters on GivingTuesday and during the year-end season by directly telling people how they can help. On its website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/en/professional/educator/school-programs/giving-tuesday&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; provides three ways for website visitors to offer their support. It even includes stories of the survivors to further encourage supporters to take action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/9359e80a-6388-4f5f-989e-417ea2c35a0e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-greater-good-charities-cause-areas-to-support&quot;&gt;4. Greater Good Charities: Cause areas to support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your organization works in multiple cause areas, why not let donors choose where they want their donation to go? It’s a great way to personalize the donor experience and give donors more control over how their gift is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For GivingTuesday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatergood.org/&quot;&gt;Greater Good Charities&lt;/a&gt; lets donors choose from four different cause areas and provides a unique landing page for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/32d1bc7e-2e7e-42f2-b3f6-4d2afae6b7ba/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to personalize the donor experience on GivingTuesday? Showing donors how far their gift will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plantwithpurpose.org/plant-a-tree/&quot;&gt;Plant With Purpose&lt;/a&gt; adds Fundraise Up’s interactive impact slider to its GivingTuesday landing page. This helps donors understand how many trees they can grow with a single donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/0626af6c-28fe-4075-8af9-465ad4e7521c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperatures rise during the last week of the calendar year. The days are long, but the final week of the calendar year for donors to make a tax-deductible gift is sizzling hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As fundraisers know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neonone.com/resources/blog/year-end-giving-statistics/&quot;&gt;one-third of all digital revenue happens in December.&lt;/a&gt; But let’s be honest: A good percentage of that occurs during the final days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 29, 30, and 31 are gangbusters. Development teams watch the money come in with great anticipation. It’s a time of year when you see what bets will pay off and how much year-over-year revenue your team will generate for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, your year-end campaign is fully cooked — emails are approved, social posts are primed, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/optimized-giving-experience-to-recruit-year-end-donors/&quot;&gt;your donation forms are optimized&lt;/a&gt; to convert casual visitors to donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could sit back and wait, but that’s not you. There are many moving parts to any online fundraising campaign, but to help you maximize your organization’s revenue during the final days of the year we’ve compiled a checklist to ensure you’re getting the most from your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy donors&lt;/strong&gt;. Practice the old adage “show me you know me” by personalizing ask amounts to intelligently predict how much someone is likely to donate based on their user activity. Technology that uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence and machine learning&lt;/a&gt; algorithms to analyze data points will right-size your gift array, impress online visitors, and ultimately convert a greater number of donors this year-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make giving a gift easy for donors.&lt;/strong&gt; Allow donors to choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/payment-options-impact/&quot;&gt;which payment option is best for them&lt;/a&gt; by providing a variety of methods optimized for their web browser, geographic location, and preferred payment type. One-click checkout options such as Apple/Google Pay makes giving easy peasy. And Venmo? Absolutely, but know thy audience (Quick tip: Enable PayPal as our data &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/showing-paypal-conversion-hike/&quot;&gt;shows a 10% lift in donations&lt;/a&gt; 🙌).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce donation form abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;. Did you know that 80% to 85% of prospective donors don’t actually complete their donation? This is money left on the table at year-end! Practice incremental gains this holiday season by focusing on the campaign (i.e. benefits of making a tax-deductible gift). What’s key is having clear, simple messaging and keeping your eyes on the prize by eliminating non-campaign-specific fields such as phone number and address (hint: it’s not required in the US).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be shy, ask… and ask again.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to make a good first impression. In the digital marketing world, three impressions are needed before a message is recognized:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make your campaign ask front and center, but not just once.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversify your fundraising asks by using image cards, sticky buttons, and/or button groups on every page. (Remember, most web visitors don’t enter your site via homepage.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always correlate the impact of a dollar through the use of imagery, creative, and/or impact sliders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you in it to win it?&lt;/strong&gt; Create some friendly competition this year-end with specific daily or weekly fundraising goals. At our core, we are competitive beings and love a good challenge. When it is for a good cause, it’s a win-win. So, let human nature reign through the combination of goal meters and stat counters showcasing your top donors and recent donations. Oh, don’t forget to highlight where your supporters are from using donor maps!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and less of a checklist item than a reminder for all year-end campaigns, incentivize donors to be their most charitable selves by allowing the best way to give for them. Make sure your donation experience allows for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/payment-options-impact/&quot;&gt;stock transfers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/crypto-guide/&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donor retention remains top of mind for nonprofits as they think about expanding their fundraising programs and growing online revenue. After all, it costs &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloomerang.co/blog/3-reasons-why-donor-retention-trumps-new-donor-acquisition/&quot;&gt;50% to 100% more&lt;/a&gt; to acquire a donor than their initial donation — that’s in addition to the fact that it could take up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lapafundraising.com/2022/01/7-key-touchpoints-to-keep-donors-engaged/#:~:text=Seven%20is%20a%20golden%20number,inclined%20to%20take%20any%20action.&quot;&gt;seven touchpoints&lt;/a&gt; before someone considers donating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with so many organizations putting efforts into increasing their donor retention rate year after year, the overall industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.givingtuesday.org/fep-report/&quot;&gt;retention rate has actually dropped 4.2%,&lt;/a&gt; according to the most recent report from The Fundraising Effectiveness Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the year coming to an end, how can you capture the generosity of the donors you worked so hard to convert throughout your year-end campaign, and what can you do differently to keep these donors from lapsing? The key to unlocking their generosity is personalizing the experience, having the right messaging, and sending a consistent flow of diversified communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-understand-why-donors-give&quot;&gt;1. Understand why donors give&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To steward donor relationships after they make their first gift, you have to understand why the donor chose to give in the first place and what your organization can do to get that donor to give again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donors want to know they are making a difference. It makes them feel secure in their decision to make a gift. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.rkdgroup.com/listen-up-ebook&quot;&gt;recent report from RKD Group&lt;/a&gt; found that donors with stronger relationships with nonprofits ranked knowing their donation is being put to good use (90%), knowing their donation has a great impact (90%), and feeling proud to be associated with the organization (90%) as top descriptors of their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to steward better relationships with donors, nonprofits need to continue communicating with donors and connect donors to their mission. The report found that factors that had the largest gap between donors with strong and weak relationships were feeling connected to the organization and good communication that goes both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive into the report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.livestorm.co/fundraise-up/year-end-retention-strategies&quot;&gt;watch our live session&lt;/a&gt; on year-end retention strategies for sustained online giving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-personalize-the-donor-experience&quot;&gt;2. Personalize the donor experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With people looking to share their generosity and give back this year-end season, it’s an opportunity to attract new website visitors and turn them into donors. While people want to know their donation is making a difference, they also value a donation process that is simplified, personalized, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/optimized-giving-experience-to-recruit-year-end-donors/&quot;&gt;optimized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like how companies make each consumer’s shopping experience tailored specifically to their preferences — like Amazon’s product recommendations or Starbucks remembering your favorite drink — your nonprofit can also personalize the giving experience for each donor. And this makes all of the difference because personalization can increase the odds of someone donating to your year-end campaign. McKinsey reports that companies that excel at personalization are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying&quot;&gt;generating 40% more revenue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see this in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone clicks the donate button on Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America’s website, they are immediately shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://bgca.org/ways-to-give?form=donate&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA14WdBhD8ARIsANao07h-WDD0i9ivOD_pwoMrvZ6FH4OdN4T_UMRjDN38CNCz4jPCkLNlYo8aAt0JEALw_wcB&quot;&gt;a checkout screen&lt;/a&gt; that includes year-end campaign-specific messaging, which tells the donor exactly what the organization is raising funds for and even incentivizes the donor with a matching-gift offer to contribute before December 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/3064a6e9-5cf3-4fd1-bb78-da03d36f9e8c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the checkout, the donor is also shown suggested donation amounts that are right-sized for them. Fundraise Up &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/&quot;&gt;uses behavioral learnings&lt;/a&gt; from millions of donors to predict how much someone is likely to give, such as geographic location, time of day, device, and browser, which has been proven successful in the nonprofits we work with. In fact, for World Health International, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/case-studies/partners-in-health&quot;&gt;73% of donors made gifts using personalized ask amounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-thank-the-donor-for-their-generosity&quot;&gt;3. Thank the donor for their generosity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s standard best practice to thank every donor who makes a gift to your organization. It should be the first step in your stewardship process, and it should happen promptly after a donation is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to say thank you — email, hand-written letter, even a short video. The most important thing is that whatever communication method you choose to thank your donor, make sure it’s personalized and addressed to that specific person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that your team is crunched for time, especially right after the busy year-end season. That’s why Fundraise Up automatically sends a thank-you email right after a donation is received. You also have the ability customize donation emails that include detailed information like the donor’s first name, the campaign they donated to, their donation amount, and the date of their donation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even attach a PDF receipt of the donation for them to keep for their records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/dc2b60db-a0e9-4707-a368-58905dbf1f88/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-keep-them-in-the-know-about-your-work&quot;&gt;4. Keep them in the know about your work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good stewardship means that you don’t stop communicating with donors after you send them their initial thank-you letter. Especially if they’re a first-time donor, they’ll appreciate the effort you put in to keep in touch with them. But that doesn’t mean that every communication they receive from you should be an ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the new year rolls around and you’re launching your next cadence of campaigns, keep your donors in the loop about what your organization is up to. Plus, don’t forget to share what your nonprofit was able to achieve with their year-end gift. Post results of your year-end efforts on your campaign landing page and send an email to your year-end donors providing that update as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rainforesttrust.org/giving-tuesday-2022/&quot;&gt;Rainforest Trust&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/1fa1b435-5cc1-483b-b952-29c09b81046a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you happen to have a monthly newsletter, be sure to add your year-end donors to that list. It’s a great way for them to get to know your organization better, learn more about its mission, and feel good about the impact that they’ve helped your organization create with their year-end donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;5-let-donors-know-how-else-they-can-offer-their-support-year-round&quot;&gt;5. Let donors know how else they can offer their support year-round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepen your relationships with your year-end donors by providing them with other ways they can support your organization — like volunteering their time, attending an upcoming event, or fundraising for your upcoming campaign. Allowing donors to take their support beyond donating gets them more involved in your mission and keeps them connected to your community of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only should you have a section on your website that highlights all the different ways to support your organization, but you should also consider sending out an email to all first-time year-end donors to let them know how they can further support your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeding Westchester has a dropdown menu on its website that includes several ways someone can get involved. Each option has its own landing page so that supporters can learn more about the ways to offer their support — one of which is starting a fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because donors already made a gift to your organization during year-end, you already know that your mission is meaningful to them. Why not encourage them to increase their support for your next campaign by starting a fundraiser? Fundraisers are simple to set up and let your supporters advocate for your cause to their network of family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend creating a dedicated landing page for fundraisers so you can explain why they should start a fundraiser, what difference it would make, and what it would entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need some inspiration? Feeding Westchester makes it easy on its supporters by outlining three simple steps to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedingwestchester.org/fundraisers/&quot;&gt;starting a fundraiser on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/0488e0d8-0efd-44af-80c7-5e85a1adfffa/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even gamifies participation by including interactive website elements like a fundraising thermometer and a top fundraisers leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;6-ask-donors-to-join-your-recurring-giving-program&quot;&gt;6. Ask donors to join your recurring giving program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that recurring donors give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.donorperfect.com/whitepapers/generic/monthly-donor-metrics/&quot;&gt;seven times as much&lt;/a&gt; as one-time donors? Plus, research finds that recurring donors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://kindful.com/nonprofit-glossary/recurring-giving/&quot;&gt;retained for more than two years&lt;/a&gt; on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your follow-up communications with your year-end donors, consider segmenting out those who opted to give a one-time gift and sending them an email about your recurring giving program. The donate call to action within the email can be linked to your donation checkout. For specific campaigns, our nonprofits at Fundraise Up can set the default giving option to be recurring, making it even easier for donors to sign up as recurring supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a more robust recurring giving program, you can include a “learn more” call to action in your email so that donors can get more information about the program before they sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, The Greater Vancouver Food Bank has created an informational landing page on its website for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://foodbank.bc.ca/ways-to-give/monthly-giving/&quot;&gt;Full Heart Club monthly giving program.&lt;/a&gt; There, supporters can learn more about the impact of their monthly contributions and how flexible the plans are to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5d5dbe16-a95f-421e-8298-7004b8eae28e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the support you’re receiving this year-end, don’t forget to put in the work next year to convert these one-time donors into long-term supporters. Your efforts will pay off as you deepen these relationships, retain more supporters, and decrease your attrition rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As organizations look for ways to innovate and keep up with their e-commerce counterparts, it’s becoming a necessity to evaluate their current &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/nonprofit-tech-stack-guide/&quot;&gt;nonprofit technology stack&lt;/a&gt; and invest in new digital tools that better fit their needs. After all, technology enables nonprofits to grow and scale their online fundraising programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire implementation of new technology can take anywhere from a matter of weeks up to six months, depending on how fast your organization is able to do its research and commit to the new technology. So, whether you’re building your fundraising technology stack for the first time or your team has decided it’s time for a complete digital makeover, there are four steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-goal-setting&quot;&gt;1. Goal-Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology plays an important role in the success of your nonprofit, it’s not the end-all-be-all to your biggest problems. Every single technology investment needs to be paired with a long-term strategy in order for it to be effective. Doing so will save you time, money, and unnecessary stress in the future by avoiding investing in a new, fancy technology before understanding how it’ll impact your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before considering adding any new solution to your growing technology stack, your nonprofit should first evaluate its needs and goals on a strategic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourselves the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your nonprofit’s long-term goals? &lt;/strong&gt;Perhaps you have a legacy all-in-one fundraising and CRM system that has non-customizable and outdated features (e.g., ineffective email automation or cumbersome donation form). Therefore, you’re looking to build a technology stack that streamlines and modernizes fundraising and donor outreach to increase donor conversion and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your budget? &lt;/strong&gt;Get your budget approved by the board before shopping for a new technology tool. This prevents any time and effort wasted for both your team and any potential technology partner’s team and ensures a smooth implementation process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can take on the responsibility of a new technology solution? &lt;/strong&gt;One thing you don’t want to run into when adopting a new technology is having no one on your team who has the skillset or bandwidth to be the key person managing and training your team on the technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-research&quot;&gt;2. Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve established what type(s) of tools you want to add to your technology stack, it’s time to do market research. When you get to this step, you can either do this yourself or hire a consultant to help guide you through the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding where to begin researching might feel a little intimidating, but the good news is that there are resources available, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabinetm.com/mstack/Nonprofit&quot;&gt;Cabinet M,&lt;/a&gt; to help you narrow down your search. When you’ve selected three to five different options to choose from, it’s time to schedule pre-demo discovery meetings with vendors to discuss your requirements. If those meetings go well, the next step is to set up product demos with no more than three companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these demo meetings, you’ll want to include people on your team who will be key stakeholders — those who will work with the tool often and will need to be the first to get trained on the product. Having a diverse representation of your team will ensure the right questions are being asked and any notable concerns are being addressed. It’s a good idea to hold a debrief meeting with your team after each vendor meeting to talk through the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-evaluation&quot;&gt;3. Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve completed all of the initial demos with technology providers you were considering, it’s time to sit down with your team to evaluate each to narrow your search down to the top one. During this process, it might be helpful to learn some red flags to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-year contracts. &lt;/strong&gt;Your organization’s technology needs will evolve over time, so it’s best to have a provider that gives you the option to go either month to month or one that has no contract at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product transparency and limitations. &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t want to find out &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; investing in a product that the technology you’ve been so excited about has limitations on what you want it to do (e.g., customization options in your automation workflow). At this stage, your prospective technology provider should have given you a full understanding of what the product can do and what it can’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No information on implementation. &lt;/strong&gt;You should have a good idea of how the new technology will get implemented into your organization. If there have been no conversations around implementation in your meetings with your prospective technology provider, it’s probably not a good sign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s on the roadmap.” &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and make your decision based on the product roadmap because there’s a possibility that the exciting feature or product might not see the light of day due to a number of factors (e.g., technical issues, funding changes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve narrowed it down to which technology solution you want to move forward with, you’ll need to schedule a few more meetings to gain a better understanding of the product, allowing your team to visualize how it’ll fit within your organization. Make sure you receive a full implementation roadmap so you know what to expect every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move on to the next step of actually implementing the technology into your organization, it’s a good idea to designate an implementation team. This implementation team will be in charge of fully understanding how to use the new technology and how it will be rolled out to the rest of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-implementation&quot;&gt;4. Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve done all the preparation, and now it’s time for the real work to begin. This final stage is phased into two parts: the physical implementation of the technology into your system and the rollout and training of the technology to your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your implementation team should have a training program in place for the rest of your team prior to this stage. Once training begins, keep in mind that change will be difficult and you’ll encounter roadblocks along the way (e.g., system glitches, frustrated employees). However, you’ll overcome these challenges once everyone has had time to learn and adapt to the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, you’ll see the fruit of your efforts through improved processes, more efficiency, and a high return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nonprofit always on the lookout for new ways to grow revenue, there’s no doubt that you’ve considered peer-to-peer fundraising or perhaps you already launched a peer-to-peer program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy that generates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peertopeerforum.com/fundraising-guides/research/&quot;&gt;more than $900 million&lt;/a&gt; in annual revenue, allowing people to fundraise on your organization’s behalf not only improves your bottom line — it strengthens your connection and builds community among your supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of your peer-to-peer program, we’re sharing five ways your nonprofit can use gamification to engage more fundraisers, promote a little friendly competition, and surpass your fundraising goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;1-give-supporters-a-specific-cause-to-fundraise-for&quot;&gt;1. Give supporters a specific cause to fundraise for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While your mission statement serves well for raising general donations, it’s important to get really specific about the purpose of any campaign you launch. It differentiates your overall mission from your near-term goals, creating a bigger impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive urgency by explaining what your immediate need is, why it’s important to your cause, and how you plan to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To gain inspiration for your next campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;https://give.ropsi.org/rainforest&quot;&gt;take a look at this example we created&lt;/a&gt;, which explains what problem the campaign is trying to solve and how to solve it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/6c55f9f2-1445-4411-8a77-ef1ff76d106c/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;2-allow-supporters-to-fundraise-together&quot;&gt;2. Allow supporters to fundraise together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiply the amount you can raise for your campaign by letting your supporters fundraise together as a team. This builds camaraderie among your community of supporters, and it encourages a little healthy competition among teams to see who can make the most impact in a given amount of time. Plus, this gives your supporters an opportunity to recruit their friends and family members to join a movement they care deeply about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Fundraise Up makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/p2p/&quot;&gt;creating P2P fundraisers super simple,&lt;/a&gt; and your supporters can sign up to become fundraisers almost immediately. Once someone clicks on the fundraising call-to-action button, they are prompted to start their own fundraiser or join an existing fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For supporters who want to start their own fundraiser, all they need to do is fill out a few short fields about the fundraiser and complete a quick email verification step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/89b9b030-b541-4813-a117-7fe4e67bc0b1/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, supporters who want to join a fundraiser can use the search bar to find the one they’re looking for or choose from a list of available fundraisers. The supporter then completes the process with a quick email verification step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/b5b85859-ff58-414f-aee6-56b4a326e37f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once supporters have their fundraiser all set up, they’ll have access to the Donor Portal where they can see who has donated to their fundraiser and get personalized sharing links to share through social channels or via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;3-set-a-fundraising-goal-for-your-campaign&quot;&gt;3. Set a fundraising goal for your campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to highlight your fundraising goal on your website so your supporters can keep track of your campaign’s progress. It’ll even motivate your fundraisers to work harder to reach that fundraising goal by the end of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective way to showcase your campaign performance on your website is by including a goal thermometer. It’ll track the progress of your campaign and show how much more is needed to help reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/0833dbc5-7614-4f02-83da-98b8773f2c83/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;4-show-off-your-top-fundraisers&quot;&gt;4. Show off your top fundraisers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fundraisers are working hard to raise more for your cause. Show them some love by highlighting your campaign’s top performers through the Top Fundraisers element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding this visual representation on your website might promote a little friendly competition among your fundraisers to make it to the top of the leaderboard — helping you reach your goal faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ed3a1450-41a1-493d-8802-268836645c03/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;5-highlight-support-from-around-the-world&quot;&gt;5. Highlight support from around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a diverse set of supporters who are from all over the world. What better way to show them off than through a donor map?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a donor map on your website lets your fundraisers see the fruit of their labor, allowing them to see where donations are coming from in real time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/5368b11b-5144-4e91-9daa-7928d5019242/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been employed by a nonprofit organization, you’ve worn many hats. The skills required for a digital-first workforce are vast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to synchronized swimming the technological components for any campaign have to be in alignment to track, analyze, and report on individual fundraising tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, how will any modern organization learn, improve, and build on previous efforts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound trivial, but it &lt;i&gt;takes a village&lt;/i&gt; for today’s nonprofit organization to be successful. Regardless of size, all organizations rely on their technology and agency partners to help them realize a return on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hope Walks, Fundraise Up’s online giving tools and &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuous.org/?utm_source=fundraiseup&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_term=partner-website-fundraise-up&quot;&gt;Virtuous’ nonprofit CRM&lt;/a&gt; proved to be the partners they needed for fundraising success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;hope-walks&quot;&gt;Hope Walks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Robinson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopewalks.org/&quot;&gt;Hope Walks&lt;/a&gt;’ Marketing &amp;amp; Content Manager, oversees the communication and marketing village that supports the organization’s growth plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Walks is the largest Christian provider of clubfoot care in the world. Since the organization independently formed in 2019, Hope Walks has used a combination of tools and partners to pair quality clubfoot treatment with compassionate care from clubfoot clinic parent advisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We became an independent organization in 2019 and have seen tremendous growth due to our partnership with Virtuous and Fundraise Up. The combination of tools has empowered us to grow our base of supporters from just a few hundred to more than 3,500 today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;campaign&quot;&gt;Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a team of one, and the wearer of many hats, Steve manages the coalition of partners for the creation and execution of any campaign. And, the 2022 year-end campaign, “Walking free from disability,” was the most ambitious yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The December 2022 fundraising goal was $250k. To break through the year-end noise, Hope Walks knew they needed a multichannel strategy for their campaign. The year-end campaign was the signature fundraising campaign that leveraged Giving Tuesday as the official kickoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village that supported Hope Walks was grounded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuous.org/?utm_source=fundraiseup&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_term=partner-website-fundraise-up&quot;&gt;Virtuous&lt;/a&gt;, a responsive fundraising CRM that has been with the organization since 2020. A partnership with Fundraise Up allowed for the seamless integration of online and offline donor data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Giving Tuesday campaign was not new to Hope Walks. In fact, previous years’ efforts had surpassed the last week of the calendar year. In partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.communityboost.org/&quot;&gt;Community Boost&lt;/a&gt;, a digital marketing agency, the plan was to “warm up” the audience with a November social media push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We’re a young organization. With only nine US staff in programs and development, we appreciate the expertise of our partners to ensure every child has a chance to walk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission-oriented videos and creative was developed and deployed in partnership with Community Boost. One week prior to Giving Tuesday, efforts were ramped up with more poignant asks, emails, and Facebook buys – a first for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rallycorp.com/&quot;&gt;Rally Corp&lt;/a&gt;, human-centered mobile messaging™ platform, was enlisted to expand reach, deepen engagement, and drive results. Though the organization had used SMS previously, incorporation of the communication channel at year-end was a fundraising first for Hope Walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the nonprofit sector, fundraising was largely flat in 2022. A downward economy tempered the results for many organizations. Despite these odds, Hope Walks raised 35% more money in December 2022 over the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no significant change in strategy, but “really an evolution” asserts Robinson. He continues, “no texting in 2021, so we did it in 2022”. This iterative approach allowed the organization to grow and expand while testing a new tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;SMS is the wave of the future. And for us, the results were very encouraging. It’s another tool in our fundraising belt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;looking-to-the-future&quot;&gt;Looking to the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the organization prepares for 2023 they will be adding more mobile to their fundraising campaigns by utilizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuous.org/software/nonprofit-marketing/?utm_source=fundraiseup&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_term=partner-website-fundraise-up&quot;&gt;Virtuous&lt;/a&gt;’ native SMS tools in the upcoming year. With the addition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuous.org/software/sms/?utm_source=fundraiseup&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=partner-website-fundraise-up&quot;&gt;native SMS tools&lt;/a&gt;, Hope Walks will have the tools they need to truly implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuous.org/lp/dynamic/?utm_source=fundraiseup&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_term=partner-website-fundraise-up&quot;&gt;responsive multi-channel communications&lt;/a&gt; out of their nonprofit CRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After such a successful year-end campaign in 2022, the future looks bright for Hope Walks. With the right tools in place, they are well positioned to generate more generosity than ever in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashboard power users rejoice! We shipped an update to the Campaigns tab in the Fundraise Up Dashboard that makes it easier than ever to quickly check the performance and settings of your fundraising campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update introduces Campaign Overview, a new page that you’ll see first when opening a campaign. The page includes two key sections: a header that displays the campaign’s key fundraising statistics, and a section for reviewing the campaign’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;get-a-snapshot-of-each-campaigns-fundraising-performance&quot;&gt;Get a snapshot of each campaign’s fundraising performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the new Campaign Overview page, you’ll see a header section with key fundraising statistics that include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many donors are moved to give in honor or memory of a loved one, especially on Mothers’ Day. Fundraise Up’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/tributes/&quot;&gt;Tributes feature&lt;/a&gt; allows you to seamlessly create highly customizable dedication experiences for your donors, making them more likely to donate to your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;offering-a-dedication-option-in-checkout&quot;&gt;Offering a dedication option in Checkout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve enabled tribute giving for your campaign, it’s quick and effortless for your donor to dedicate their donation to someone special in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a visitor clicks the donate button on your site, a simple “Dedicate this donation” checkbox appears in the checkout screen (unchecked by default). As our goal is to always maximize your conversion rate, a majority of dedication-related steps are completed in Donor Portal after the donation is processed to prevent a lengthy workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/726b0ffb-9e01-44a5-90e4-132ec80780ff/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up makes dedicating donations as simple as checking a box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your donor clicks the “Dedicate this donation” option, they simply enter a name in the field for their tribute and complete their donation as they normally would. After their tribute gift is processed, they have the option to send a personalized card or make another dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sending a card, donors can select a dedication type (in honor or in memory), pick a channel (email or postal mail), opt to show or hide the donation amount and choose a custom image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;tribute-giving-through-email-campaigns&quot;&gt;Tribute giving through email campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to launch a Mothers’ Day email campaign, you might want to include a CTA to dedicate a donation. To measure conversion and the performance of other marketing metrics, make sure to leverage our Donate Link in your CTA, which generates a unique tracking URL, allowing you to collect rich campaign data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d17d0af8-e5bb-4984-9537-359ec9ed1469/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribute gifts are an opportunity to grow online revenue, increase your brand awareness, and garner new supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recipient clicks on your CTA to make a gift, Fundraise Up’s Checkout form will launch and the “Dedicate this donation” option will be switched on by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Checkout, we only enable the Mothers’ Day image collection because we have a special set of images we want to use for this campaign. When you send a tribute email from Donor Portal, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bd9c7045-307e-4323-a678-f3211945396f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donors can choose from a variety of images to accompany their dedication; all pre-curated and categorized by your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;direct-donors-to-your-mothers-day-campaign-with-our-popup-element&quot;&gt;Direct donors to your Mothers’ Day campaign with our Popup Element&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to draw traffic to your Mothers’ Day campaign? Popups can be an incredibly effective addition to your marketing mix, with the best-performing ones netting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/60-exit-intent-pop-up-examples-that-convert-plus-bonus-tactics/&quot;&gt;60% conversion rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Fundraise Up, you can easily guide donors to give on Mothers’ Day with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/popup/&quot;&gt;Popup element&lt;/a&gt;, which requires no extra code to install on your website and comes at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once enabled, Popup launches in the center of a visitor’s screen, dimming the content behind it to emphasize the opportunity to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/1e3ba50e-890e-4aa7-bf46-835363cbc1f4/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/engage-with-popup/&quot;&gt;Popup&lt;/a&gt; to display attention-grabbing calls to action proven to boost conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like our other Elements, Popup is highly customizable, allowing you to add an image, title, description, CTA button, and time for the popup to display. Our URL control feature also allows you to pick and choose which pages to trigger the popup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Popup’s incredible versatility, it also looks great on any device and our AI-driven features ensure that your popup is optimized in terms of both how and when it’s shown to visitors. For more optimization techniques, make sure to check out our article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/engage-with-popup/&quot;&gt;Popup best practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=45cd8fd0-06a0-4c5e-96be-b0bda4df1eb6&gt;Create, configure, and launch donation pages in minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=13dfcd11-55a1-46e1-b910-78e1fbad3d79&gt;Multiply impact with rate matching campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engage donors with match or challenge campaigns. Using the new rate matching feature, you can call out donation matching opportunities directly on your donation pages.

You can even include a match sponsor name to create meaningful brand awareness for your organization’s fundraising partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=f82f140a-bcd1-415e-a827-c75f1dbaee93&gt;Raise more with conversion-optimized donation pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because Campaign Pages leverage the same standard-setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/machine-learning/&quot;&gt;AI-optimizations&lt;/a&gt; that power Checkout Modal, you can provide donors with personalized ask arrays and intelligently present opportunities to convert to recurring support.&lt;/p&gt;

When your recurring donors visit these links, they can select from a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/machine-learning/&quot;&gt;personalized upgrade amounts&lt;/a&gt; and increase the size of their donations without having to reenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/payment-methods&quot;&gt;payment method&lt;/a&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=a903ae5c-5671-4ae2-ade5-c1ff014a3fb1&gt;Increase recurring donation revenue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/c6817342-ba99-452a-9dbf-1f76f99815db/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Upgrade Links to upgrade donors and increase recurring donation revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurring giving is the most powerful way for donors to provide ongoing support. With Upgrade Links, it’s now easy for these donors to increase their support over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider a donor who opts-in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/recurring-giving/&quot;&gt;recurring giving&lt;/a&gt; when making a donation to your organization. Their monthly donation might begin as a $10 gift, but by incorporating Upgrade Links into an annual upgrade email that you send, you can create a seamless experience for the donor to increase their support. That original $10 amount can then easily become a $20 or $30 monthly gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Upgrade Links, not only can you have multiply the lifetime value of individual donors, you can dramatically increase the output of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/recurring-giving/&quot;&gt;recurring giving&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e64d6f30-676e-4cd3-8199-a435d0dad642&gt;Ask for the right donation amount&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/ba188cc5-d981-40fc-ac45-ec1ff5f6e9d6/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade Links leverage Fundraise Up AI to provide donors with right-sized upgrade amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the ask right has always been a challenge, especially when trying to figure out an appropriate upgrade amount. But with Upgrade Links, you can put complicated spreadsheets and complex Excel formulas behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade Links &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/machine-learning/&quot;&gt;use AI &lt;/a&gt;to tailor upgrade amounts for each of your recurring donors. Using more than 100 personalization data points, this AI-assisted approach ensures that only the upgrade amounts most likely to be selected by a donor are displayed. And because Fundraise Up’s AI technology uses only first-party data, you can upgrade donors knowing their &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/security/&quot;&gt;privacy comes first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e74fe3b7-01ae-42f4-8e26-2686fb3bb1a3&gt;Upgrade donors in one click&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f36b7b3f-c756-46cc-8a9b-08269b261f65/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade Links provide a seamless upgrade experience for donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, getting donors to complete their upgrade has been tough. You’ve likely struggled with helping donors log into accounts they’ve forgetting the passwords to, getting them reenter &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/payment-methods&quot;&gt;payment method&lt;/a&gt; information, or coaxing them into completing the upgrade process over the phone. Upgrade Links are here to increase the success of your upgrade efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Upgrade Links, the upgrade experience occurs in as little as one click. It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/security/&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/a&gt; and seamless way to get your upgrades over the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=6a4e07a2-80c4-4e14-8741-588f3fa12e55&gt;Links with verification&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/d187d371-1f6f-4e78-8e06-f2d32cfa32c7/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links with verification include a confirmation step in the upgrade flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to create Upgrade Links is using an approach that includes a verification step. In this approach, a donor selects an upgrade amount and then confirms it by verifying their email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=634cefda-e90d-4059-9716-cd36566518aa&gt;Links with encryption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/9621faf4-7b10-433b-8a2a-4c2f3f1dbbdd/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links with encryption provide the fastest upgrade experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade Links created using this approach utilize SHA256 encryption to identify supporters and their recurring donation plans. Because each link includes a signature unique to individual donors, the upgrade experience can be completed without an email verification step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=54472e61-66cd-449e-a9a8-c5800030941c&gt;Two types of upgrades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Upgrade Links to encourage upgrades in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ff6ce47e-4e65-420c-a685-11abb7a080f8&gt;Donation amount upgrades&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/7e920183-fcda-47ef-9b78-fc51a7cfe8e2/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgrade a donor’s recurring donation amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donation amount upsells do just that — they encourage donors to increase their base donation amount. Three AI-personalized upgrade amounts and a fourth donor-customizable amount are offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=fae5af60-4965-49a3-a8fa-6b93035afc45&gt;Cost coverage upgrades&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/407fdbb6-c33c-4325-b66f-1fe91833fe5d/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encourage a donor to cover their donation’s transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost coverage upsells encourage donors to cover the transaction fees associated with their recurring donations. While almost all donors opt to cover transaction costs when making a donation, using this upsell approach with donors who don’t cover costs can be an effective way of reducing costs and increasing revenue from recurring giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=071a4868-8e88-464a-ab92-bd884db629ed&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best practices for using Upgrade Links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our partners at &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.fundraiseup.com/partners/mediacause&quot;&gt;Media Cause&lt;/a&gt; are leveraging Upgrade Links to grow giving for their nonprofit clients. Here are a few recommendations they have for getting the most out of Upgrade Links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Upgrade Links every January alongside your sustainer acquisition campaigns, upsell existing donors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up an automated anniversary email to upgrade sustainers. Include personalize impact statistics and an upgrade CTA that uses an Upgrade Link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include an Upgrade Link in an upgrade CTA that’s integrated into your email templates. Use a display rule to show the CTA when the email recipient is an active recurring donor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to only target active recurring donors. Inactive recurring donors can’t be upgraded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primarily target mid and low-level donors. Large-scale or automated upgrade campaign work best with these segments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask for upgrades too often. Once every three-six months is recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to upgrade donors too soon. We recommend waiting at least three months before upgrading new recurring donors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus most of your upgrade efforts on how you make the ask. Donors should feel that increasing their support will produce perceivable value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=82fc0082-6b4f-4059-b884-a233c1127891&gt;Start using Upgrade Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the perfect time to integrate Upgrade Links with your fundraising strategy. If you’re an existing Fundraise Up customer, you can start using upgrade links right now—explore the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/docs/recurring-plans-settings/#upsell-links&quot;&gt;recurring giving docs&lt;/a&gt; to see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q4 is in full swing. I’m sure you’re head-down with final GivingTuesday and year-end campaign prep. I hope everything is coming together well and that you’re feeling ready for giving season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re here to support you—always—and especially during this critical time of the year. A lot of what we have to offer has to do with features and functionalities, but know that there’s also 100+ team members here at Fundraise Up who are deeply invested in your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ve compiled a collection of resources that I hope provide you with value in this final stretch of the year. Again, I’m sure you’re busy and short on time, but skim what you can. You never know what inspiration you might find or help you might get from what I’ve included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;new-and-notable-features&quot;&gt;New and notable features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two quarters, our roadmap has focused on high-impact features that significantly increase donor engagement and revenue. Here are three new and notable features that I want to make sure are on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=727382d7-be6d-4d0d-90f4-c875572efcf9&gt;Campaign Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/2c083829-2321-4907-bd59-4d0a5b6ecf72/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create and launch donation landing pages quickly with the recently released Campaign Pages feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Campaign Pages to quickly create and launch high-conversion donation landing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign Pages excel at driving conversions off of paid ads, email blasts, SMS campaigns, corporate sponsorships, and other scenarios where hosting a dedication page makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;🥾&quot; class=&quot;callout default&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/campaign-pages/&quot;&gt;Continue learning about Campaign Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=a1d109f9-27ea-4aac-8dc3-795a17ffe91f&gt;Upgrade Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/a63863b2-809b-40c2-83eb-97b4c2946a1b/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Upgrade Links, you can create personalized upgrade links for your recurring donors. These links can be included in emails, text messages, and other communications. When a donor visits the link, they’re invited to upgrade their existing recurring donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for an alternate GivingTuesday ask for your existing donors, I recommend asking them to upgrade their support instead of making a new one-time donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;🥾&quot; class=&quot;callout default&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/upsell-links/&quot;&gt;Continue reading about Upgrade Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=1afcc218-a79e-4d4d-a3b9-30779e8a1196&gt;ACH Direct Debit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recent enhancements to the ACH payment method activate an incredible new functionality: automatic verification. With automatic verification, you can validate a donor’s bank account and routing information without micro-deposit verification. If you’ve ever had to deal with micro-deposit verification, you know how big of an improvement this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatic verification is designed to increase ACH donation conversion. Since ACH is typically used by supporters to make substantial donations, this ACH improvement is a big win ahead of your year-end fundraising push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average ACH donation size: $117 USD (~1.7x greater than a cash donation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;⚙️&quot; class=&quot;callout default&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.fundraiseup.com/settings/payment-options/us-bank-account?referral=blog&quot;&gt;Configure automatic verification for your account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/bd1d7440-2de9-4654-82a4-8d6c9dae8c6e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore new features and subscribe to product updates on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/docs/changelog/&quot;&gt;What’s new&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, I highlighted three key features you should know about, but there’s more too explore! New features and improvements roll off the assembly line and into your Fundraise Up account every day. To stay up to date with the latest releases, bookmark the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/docs/changelog/&quot;&gt;What’s new&lt;/a&gt; page on our website and sign up to receive monthly product updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;stock-giving-on-your-website&quot;&gt;Stock giving on your website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/540f5dbb-c906-42cd-9c86-c99b35f79df1/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accept major gifts on your website by offering stock as a donation option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By offering stock as a donation option on your website, you create a pathway to greater incredible generosity. I encourage you to think of online stock giving not as a replacement for your traditional stock giving, but as an augmentation — a way to capture major support from even more donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average stock donation size: $5,000 USD (~74x greater than a cash donation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-emoji=&quot;🥾&quot; class=&quot;callout default&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/stock-giving/&quot;&gt;Continue learning about stock giving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;crypto-giving-on-your-website&quot;&gt;Crypto giving on your website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f0b2af3c-d8b7-4278-9025-80d56728367f/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlock generosity by accepting crypto donations on your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your organization can be on the receiving end of a crypto donor’s generosity. Enabling crypto giving for your organization is easy, and you can connect Gemini to the platform. If you’re not sure which provider you should use, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundraiseup.com/blog/coinbase-vs-gemini/&quot;&gt;refer to this writeup&lt;/a&gt; we did on picking the crypto exchange that’s right for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average crypto donation size: $1,300 USD (~20x greater than a cash donation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-table-of-contents=&quot;&quot; data-transformed-header=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;ai-optimizations-that-grow-giving&quot;&gt;AI optimizations that grow giving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/f5070046-fd74-4588-963d-b33f7679109e/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can help with a lot, and this quarter, it’s here to help you personalize the donor experience at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a three of our AI features that I recommend enabling for any campaign, and especially your GivingTuesday and year-end campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=19c414af-2483-4140-bb3b-406b3e5c8ff6&gt;Personalized suggested amounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized suggested amounts take the guesswork out of getting the ask right. Using AI, we’re able to display an array of six donation amount suggestions and a pre-filled donation value that is tailored to each donor. The outcome is an increase in conversion — a big win for your year-end campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=9e1af9d1-494d-4062-a3da-fd7c8aaadf66&gt;Monthly donation upsells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurring giving offers a firm foundation for any fundraising program, and by enabling upsells, you can automatically add to that foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of upsells: a pre-donation upsell and a post-donation upsell. Both are effective at converting one-time donors to recurring supporters. You can enable one or both upsells — just make sure that you’re leveraging this powerful AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=e47a478d-6757-4557-93a2-4ca347d039bc&gt;Adaptive cost coverage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most donors are able and willing to cover the costs of processing their donations. But figuring out which of them will (and avoiding a drop in conversion) is a science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Adaptive cost coverage comes int play. Using AI, we dynamically determine the donors who should be asked to cover fees. The result is an increase in conversion, an increase in donation revenue, and an increase in the number of donors who cover costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable Adaptive cost coverage for your EOY campaigns to automate greater giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Q4, getting good help is important. Whether you need to take a deep dive into product documentation or get live help from someone, we have people and resources to help you brainstorm and problem solve. And whether you’re raising millions of dollars or just starting out with the platform, getting help from Fundraise Up is always free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=de4da756-cdf3-40ba-9492-4e673533ed3f&gt;Customer Success team&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers with a Customer Success Manager (CSM), remember that this team member is available to help you configure your campaigns, provide best-practices insights, and double-check your settings before you launch your GivingTuesday and year-end fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get help from your Customer Success Manager, call or email them directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=ce58e1cc-3266-4839-b4e4-ed16c71cadbb&gt;365-day support coverage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraise Up leads the way with support coverage. Our Support team is available 6 AM–7 PM Eastern time during the week and 6 AM–3 PM Eastern time on the weekends. Emergency support is available 24/7. And because this coverage include major holidays, there’s always a team member ready to help whenever you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=93d6bbcc-fe61-4e72-b148-1406cb251c6a&gt;100% uptime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our legal team says we can’t technically market 100% uptime, but if you check our &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.fundraiseup.com/&quot;&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that it’s been the case since March 2021!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal. 100% uptime means the platform doesn’t go down — even for maintenance. You don’t have to worry about service disruptions on GivingTuesday or any other important fundraising day. Even under the heaviest loads, the platform will continue to deliver success for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3  data-transformed-header=true data-block-id=aeb57978-9a69-4781-86ba-7730f7079daf&gt;LettrLabs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block-with-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ucarecdn.com/133ca7dc-a0f9-40b7-a7af-70f286a3938a/-/format/auto/-/resize/1600x/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the issue of a 60% churn rate among new donors requires implementing robust donor stewardship strategies. The most effective method LettrLabs discovered from working with numerous nonprofits is a simple, personal thank-you to acknowledge their contribution. However, it isn&amp;#39;t always practical for a non-profit to personally acknowledge every donation, and a one-size-fits-all approach often falls short due to its lack of a personal touch. To combat this, we&amp;#39;ve compiled 4 crucial thank-you scripts tailored for first-time, mid-level, and major donors. Moreover, we&amp;#39;ve included 10 general thank-you scripts suitable for any occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to adopting Virtuous, the Morgan Autism Center juggled several systems to oversee its fundraising and marketing operations. The simultaneous use of three tools resulted in substantial redundancy and difficulty in efficiently accessing and utilizing donor data. However, with Virtuous providing a consolidated view of donor data, the Morgan Autism Center is now able to dispatch tailored communications for GivingTuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persuading individuals to contribute financially necessitates a robust link between the prospective benefactor and the cause. Your nonprofit isn&amp;#39;t advertising a product or service, but rather soliciting assistance for a situation. The requisite subtlety and context seldom fit within the confines of conventional marketing methods. For fundraising purposes, the optimal approach is to connect with people personally, revealing the narrative behind your mission—you&amp;#39;ll find SMS messaging can significantly amplify this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncharitable is a gripping documentary film that dives deep into the world of philanthropy and charity. Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danpallotta.com/uncharitable&quot;&gt;provocative book&lt;/a&gt; of the same name by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danpallotta.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Pallotta&lt;/a&gt;, the film challenges our preconceived notions about how charities should operate and raises important questions about the true impact of our giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pallotta is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong?language=en&quot;&gt;renowned speaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danpallotta.com/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; who has dedicated his career to revolutionizing the nonprofit sector. In Uncharitable, he argues that the way we think about charity is dead wrong. He believes that society&amp;#39;s nonprofit ethic acts as a strict regulatory mechanism on the natural economic law. It creates an economic apartheid that denies the nonprofit sector critical tools and permissions that the for-profit sector is allowed to use without restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is a must-watch for anyone involved in or interested in the nonprofit sector. It&amp;#39;s thought-provoking, challenging, and might just change the way you think about giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncharitable is a must-watch for anyone involved in the nonprofit sector, including charity workers, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. It&amp;#39;s also highly recommended for individuals interested in social issues or those who donate to charities and want to understand more about the sector&amp;#39;s inner workings. Furthermore, educators and students studying social sciences might find the documentary insightful and thought-provoking. Lastly, leaders and policymakers who can influence the regulations surrounding nonprofits could benefit from the film&amp;#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the 16th most commented TED Talks of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncharitable offers a fresh perspective on philanthropy and the nonprofit sector, challenging the conventional wisdom that often governs our thinking about charity and giving. By watching Uncharitable, you will gain a deeper understanding of the constraints and challenges that charities face and how our current mindset can hinder their growth and impact. Whether you&amp;#39;re a donor, a nonprofit worker, or simply someone interested in social issues, this film will provide you with valuable insights and may inspire you to rethink your approach to giving and social change.&lt;/p&gt;
